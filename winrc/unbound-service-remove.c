comment|/**  * \file  *  * This file contains functions to integrate with the windows services API.  * This means it handles the commandline switches to install and remove  * the service (via CreateService and DeleteService), it handles  * the ServiceMain() main service entry point when started as a service,  * and it handles the Handler[_ex]() to process requests to the service  * (such as start and stop and status).  */
