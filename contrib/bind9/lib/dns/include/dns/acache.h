comment|/*  * Acache  *   * The Additional Cache Object  *  *	This module manages internal caching entries that correspond to  *	the additional section data of a DNS DB node (an RRset header, more  *	accurately).  An additional cache entry is expected to be (somehow)  *	attached to a particular RR in a particular DB node, and contains a set  *	of information of an additional data for the DB node.  *  *	An additional cache object is intended to be created as a per-view  *	object, and manages all cache entries within the view.  *  *	The intended usage of the additional caching is to provide a short cut  *	to additional glue RRs of an NS RR.  For each NS RR, it is often  *	necessary to look for glue RRs to make a proper response.  Once the  *	glue RRs are known, the additional caching allows the client to  *	associate the information to the original NS RR so that further  *	expensive lookups can be avoided for the NS RR.  *  *	Each additional cache entry contains information to identify a  *	particular DB node and (optionally) an associated RRset.  The  *	information consists of its zone, database, the version of the  *	database, database node, and RRset.  *  *	A "negative" information can also be cached.  For example, if a glue  *	RR does not exist as an authoritative data in the same zone as that  *	of the NS RR, this fact can be cached by specifying a NULL pointer  *	for the database, version, and node.  (See the description for  *	dns_acache_getentry() below for more details.)  *  *	Since each member stored in an additional cache entry holds a reference  *	to a corresponding object, a stale cache entry may cause unnecessary  *	memory consumption.  For instance, when a zone is reloaded, additional  *	cache entries that have a reference to the zone (and its DB and/or  *	DB nodes) can delay the cleanup of the referred objects.  In order to  *	minimize such a bad effect, this module provides several cleanup  *	mechanisms.  *  *	The first one is a shutdown procedure called when the associated view  *	is shut down.  In this case, dns_acache_shutdown() will be called and  *	all cache entries will be purged.  This mechanism will help the  *	situation when the configuration is reloaded or the main server is  *	stopped.  *  *	Per-DB cleanup mechanism is also provided.  Each additional cache entry  *	is associated with related DB, which is expected to have been  *	registered when the DB was created by dns_acache_setdb().  If a  *	particular DB is going to be destroyed, the primary holder of the DB,  *	a typical example of which is a zone, will call dns_acache_putdb().  *	Then this module will clean-up all cache entries associated with the  *	DB.  This mechanism is effective when a secondary zone DB is going to  *	be stale after a zone transfer.  *  *	Finally, this module supports for periodic clean-up of stale entries.  *	Each cache entry has a timestamp field, which is updated every time  *	the entry is referred.  A periodically invoked cleaner checks the  *	timestamp of each entry, and purge entries that have not been referred  *	for a certain period.  The cleaner interval can be specified by  *	dns_acache_setcleaninginterval().  If the periodic clean-up is not  *	enough, it is also possible to specify the upper limit of entries  *	in terms of the memory consumption.  If the maximum value is  *	specified, the cleaner is invoked when the memory consumption reaches  *	the high watermark inferred from the maximum value.  In this case,  *	the cleaner will use more aggressive algorithm to decide the "victim"  *	entries.  The maximum value can be specified by  *	dns_acache_setcachesize().  *  *	When a cache entry is going to be purged within this module, the  *	callback function specified at the creation time will be called.  *	The callback function is expected to release all internal resources  *	related to the entry, which will typically be specific to DB  *	implementation, and to call dns_acache_detachentry().  The callback  *	mechanism is very important, since the holder of an additional cache  *	entry may not be able to initiate the clean-up of the entry, due to  *	the reference ordering.  For example, as long as an additional cache  *	entry has a reference to a DB object, the DB cannot be freed, in which  *	a DB node may have a reference to the cache entry.  *  *	Credits:  *	The basic idea of this kind of short-cut for frequently used  *	information is similar to the "pre-compiled answer" approach adopted  *	in nsd by NLnet LABS with RIPE NCC.  Our work here is an independent  *	effort, but the success of nsd encouraged us to pursue this path.  *  *	The design and implementation of the periodic memory management and  *	the upper limitation of memory consumption was derived from the cache  *	DB implementation of BIND9.  *  * MP:  *	There are two main locks in this module.  One is for each entry, and  *	the other is for the additional cache object.  *  * Reliability:  *	The callback function for a cache entry is called with holding the  *	entry lock.  Thus, it implicitly assumes the callback function does not  *	call a function that can require the lock.  Typically, the only  *	function that can be called from the callback function safely is  *	dns_acache_detachentry().  The breakage of this implicit assumption  *	may cause a deadlock.  *  * Resources:  *	In a 32-bit architecture (such as i386), the following additional  *	memory is required comparing to the case that disables this module.  *	- 76 bytes for each additional cache entry  *	- if the entry has a DNS name and associated RRset,  *	  * 44 bytes + size of the name (1-255 bytes)  *	  * 52 bytes x number_of_RRs   *	- 28 bytes for each DB related to this module  *  *	Using the additional cache also requires extra memory consumption in  *	the DB implementation.  In the current implementation for rbtdb, we  *	need:  *	- two additional pointers for each DB node (8 bytes for a 32-bit  *	  architecture  *	- for each RR associated to an RR in a DB node, we also need  *	  a pointer and management objects to support the additional cache  *	  function.  These are allocated on-demand.  The total size is  *	  32 bytes for a 32-bit architecture.  *  * Security:  *	Since this module does not handle any low-level data directly,  *	no security issue specific to this module is anticipated.  *  * Standards:  *	None.  */
