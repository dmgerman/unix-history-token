comment|/*%<  * Use the system resolver to get the addresses associated with a hostname.  * If successful, the number of addresses found is returned in 'addrcount'.  * If a hostname lookup is performed and addresses of an unknown family is  * seen, it is ignored.  If more than 'addrsize' addresses are seen, the  * first 'addrsize' are returned and the remainder silently truncated.  *  * This routine may block.  If called by a program using the isc_app  * framework, it should be surrounded by isc_app_block()/isc_app_unblock().  *  *  Requires:  *\li	'hostname' is not NULL.  *\li	'addrs' is not NULL.  *\li	'addrsize'> 0  *\li	'addrcount' is not NULL.  *  *  * Returns:  *\li	#ISC_R_SUCCESS  *\li	#ISC_R_NOTFOUND  *\li	#ISC_R_NOFAMILYSUPPORT - 'hostname' is an IPv6 address, and IPv6 is  *		not supported.  */
