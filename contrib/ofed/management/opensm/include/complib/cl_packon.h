comment|/****h* Component Library/Structure Packing * NAME *	Structure Packing * * DESCRIPTION *	The structure packing header files allow packing structures on byte *	boundaries. * *	Structure packing should be used whenever a structure is transmitted *	between systems, as different platforms pad structures differently if *	they are not packed.  Packing a structure that is not transmitted between *	systems can be detrimental to performance, as fields in the structure may *	not align properly for some platforms. Care must be taken when creating *	packed structures that the alignment rules for all platforms are followed. * *	To pack a structure, include ipackon.h before defining the structure, and *	include ipackoff.h after the structure definition.  Multiple structures *	can be packed between the two include statements if desired. * *	The structure definition itself must use the PACK_SUFFIX keyword. * * EXAMPLE *	#include<complib/ipackon.h> * *	typedef _my_struct_t *	{ *	    uint64 large; *	    uint32 medium; *	    uint16 small; * *	} PACK_SUFFIX my_struct_t; *	#include<complib/ipackoff.h> *********/
