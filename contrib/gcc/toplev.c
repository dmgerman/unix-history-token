We also keep static consts if not optimizing (for debugging),      unless the user specified -fno-keep-static-consts.      ??? They might be better written into the debug information.      This is possible when using DWARF.       A language processor that wants static constants to be always      written out (even if it is not used) is responsible for      calling rest_of_decl_compilation itself.  E.g. the C front-end      calls rest_of_decl_compilation from finish_decl.      One motivation for this is that is conventional in some      environments to write things like:      static const char rcsid[] = "... version string ...";      intending to force the string to be in the executable.       A language processor that would prefer to have unneeded      static constants "optimized away" would just defer writing      them out until here.  E.g. C++ does this, because static      constants are often defined in header files.       ??? A tempting alternative (for both C and C++) would be      to force a constant to be written if and only if it is      defined in a main file, as opposed to an include file.  */
