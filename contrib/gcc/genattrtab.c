comment|/* This program handles insn attributes and the DEFINE_DELAY and    DEFINE_FUNCTION_UNIT definitions.     It produces a series of functions named `get_attr_...', one for each insn    attribute.  Each of these is given the rtx for an insn and returns a member    of the enum for the attribute.     These subroutines have the form of a `switch' on the INSN_CODE (via    `recog_memoized').  Each case either returns a constant attribute value    or a value that depends on tests on other attributes, the form of    operands, or some random C expression (encoded with a SYMBOL_REF    expression).     If the attribute `alternative', or a random C expression is present,    `constrain_operands' is called.  If either of these cases of a reference to    an operand is found, `extract_insn' is called.     The special attribute `length' is also recognized.  For this operand,    expressions involving the address of an operand or the current insn,    (address (pc)), are valid.  In this case, an initial pass is made to    set all lengths that do not depend on address.  Those that do are set to    the maximum length.  Then each insn that depends on an address is checked    and possibly has its length changed.  The process repeats until no further    changed are made.  The resulting lengths are saved for use by    `get_attr_length'.     A special form of DEFINE_ATTR, where the expression for default value is a    CONST expression, indicates an attribute that is constant for a given run    of the compiler.  The subroutine generated for these attributes has no    parameters as it does not depend on any particular insn.  Constant    attributes are typically used to specify which variety of processor is    used.     Internal attributes are defined to handle DEFINE_DELAY and    DEFINE_FUNCTION_UNIT.  Special routines are output for these cases.     This program works by keeping a list of possible values for each attribute.    These include the basic attribute choices, default values for attribute, and    all derived quantities.     As the description file is read, the definition for each insn is saved in a    `struct insn_def'.   When the file reading is complete, a `struct insn_ent'    is created for each insn and chained to the corresponding attribute value,    either that specified, or the default.     An optimization phase is then run.  This simplifies expressions for each    insn.  EQ_ATTR tests are resolved, whenever possible, to a test that    indicates when the attribute has the specified value for the insn.  This    avoids recursive calls during compilation.     The strategy used when processing DEFINE_DELAY and DEFINE_FUNCTION_UNIT    definitions is to create arbitrarily complex expressions and have the    optimization simplify them.     Once optimization is complete, any required routines and definitions    will be written.     An optimization that is not yet implemented is to hoist the constant    expressions entirely out of the routines and definitions that are written.    A way to do this is to iterate over all possible combinations of values    for constant attributes and generate a set of functions for that given    combination.  An initialization function would be written that evaluates    the attributes and installs the corresponding set of routines and    definitions (each would be accessed through a pointer).     We use the flags in an RTX as follows:    `unchanging' (RTX_UNCHANGING_P): This rtx is fully simplified       independent of the insn code.    `in_struct' (MEM_IN_STRUCT_P): This rtx is fully simplified       for the insn code currently being processed (see optimize_attrs).    `integrated' (RTX_INTEGRATED_P): This rtx is permanent and unique       (see attr_rtx).    `volatil' (MEM_VOLATILE_P): During simplify_by_exploding the value of an       EQ_ATTR rtx is true if !volatil and false if volatil.  */

comment|/* An expression where all the unknown terms are EQ_ATTR tests can be    rearranged into a COND provided we can enumerate all possible    combinations of the unknown values.  The set of combinations become the    tests of the COND; the value of the expression given that combination is    computed and becomes the corresponding value.  To do this, we must be    able to enumerate all values for each attribute used in the expression    (currently, we give up if we find a numeric attribute).     If the set of EQ_ATTR tests used in an expression tests the value of N    different attributes, the list of all possible combinations can be made    by walking the N-dimensional attribute space defined by those    attributes.  We record each of these as a struct dimension.     The algorithm relies on sharing EQ_ATTR nodes: if two nodes in an    expression are the same, the will also have the same address.  We find    all the EQ_ATTR nodes by marking them MEM_VOLATILE_P.  This bit later    represents the value of an EQ_ATTR node, so once all nodes are marked,    they are also given an initial value of FALSE.     We then separate the set of EQ_ATTR nodes into dimensions for each    attribute and put them on the VALUES list.  Terms are added as needed by    `add_values_to_cover' so that all possible values of the attribute are    tested.     Each dimension also has a current value.  This is the node that is    currently considered to be TRUE.  If this is one of the nodes added by    `add_values_to_cover', all the EQ_ATTR tests in the original expression    will be FALSE.  Otherwise, only the CURRENT_VALUE will be true.     NUM_VALUES is simply the length of the VALUES list and is there for    convenience.     Once the dimensions are created, the algorithm enumerates all possible    values and computes the current value of the given expression.  */

IS_CONST indicates whether the expression is constant for each compiler    run (a constant expression may not test any particular insn).     Convert (eq_attr "att" "a1,a2") to (ior (eq_attr ... ) (eq_attrq ..))    and (eq_attr "att" "!a1") to (not (eq_attr "att" "a1")).  Do the latter    test first so that (eq_attr "att" "!a1,a2,a3") works as expected.     Update the string address in EQ_ATTR expression to be the same used    in the attribute (or `alternative_name') to speed up subsequent    `find_attr' calls and eliminate most `strcmp' calls.     Return the new expression, if any.  */

First, we compute the number of delay slots for each insn (as a COND of    each of the test expressions in DEFINE_DELAYs).  Then, if more than one    delay type is specified, we compute a similar function giving the    DEFINE_DELAY ordinal for each insn.     Finally, for each [DEFINE_DELAY, slot #] pair, we compute an attribute that    tells whether a given insn can be in that delay slot.     Normal attribute filling and optimization expands these to contain the    information needed to handle delay slots.  */

comment|/* Once all attributes and DEFINE_FUNCTION_UNITs have been read, we    construct a number of attributes.     The first produces a function `function_units_used' which is given an    insn and produces an encoding showing which function units are required    for the execution of that insn.  If the value is non-negative, the insn    uses that unit; otherwise, the value is a one's compliment mask of units    used.     The second produces a function `result_ready_cost' which is used to    determine the time that the result of an insn will be ready and hence    a worst-case schedule.     Both of these produce quite complex expressions which are then set as the    default value of internal attributes.  Normal attribute simplification    should produce reasonable expressions.     For each unit, a `<name>_unit_ready_cost' function will take an    insn and give the delay until that unit will be ready with the result    and a `<name>_unit_conflict_cost' function is given an insn already    executing on the unit and a candidate to execute and will give the    cost from the time the executing insn started until the candidate    can start (ignore limitations on the number of simultaneous insns).     For each unit, a `<name>_unit_blockage' function is given an insn    already executing on the unit and a candidate to execute and will    give the delay incurred due to function unit conflicts.  The range of    blockage cost values for a given executing insn is given by the    `<name>_unit_blockage_range' function.  These values are encoded in    an int where the upper half gives the minimum value and the lower    half gives the maximum value.  */

This is the maximum of the issue 	     delay, the pipeline delay, and the simultaneity constraint. 	     Each function_unit_op represents the characteristics of the 	     candidate insn, so in the expressions below, C is a known 	     term and E is an unknown term.  	     We compute the blockage cost for each E for every possible C. 	     Thus OP represents E, and READYCOST is a list of values for 	     every possible C.  	     The issue delay function for C is op->issue_exp and is used to 	     write the `<name>_unit_conflict_cost' function.  Symbolicly 	     this is "ISSUE-DELAY (E,C)".  	     The pipeline delay results form the FIFO constraint on the 	     function unit and is "READY-COST (E) + 1 - READY-COST (C)".  	     The simultaneity constraint is based on how long it takes to 	     fill the unit given the minimum issue delay.  FILL-TIME is the 	     constant "MIN (ISSUE-DELAY (*,*)) * (SIMULTANEITY - 1)", and 	     the simultaneity constraint is "READY-COST (E) - FILL-TIME" 	     if SIMULTANEITY is non-zero and zero otherwise.  	     Thus, BLOCKAGE (E,C) when SIMULTANEITY is zero is  	         MAX (ISSUE-DELAY (E,C), 		      READY-COST (E) - (READY-COST (C) - 1))  	     and otherwise  	         MAX (ISSUE-DELAY (E,C), 		      READY-COST (E) - (READY-COST (C) - 1), 		      READY-COST (E) - FILL-TIME)  	     The `<name>_unit_blockage' function is computed by determining 	     this value for each candidate insn.  As these values are 	     computed, we also compute the upper and lower bounds for 	     BLOCKAGE (E,*).  These are combined to form the function 	     `<name>_unit_blockage_range'.  Finally, the maximum blockage 	     cost, MAX (BLOCKAGE (*,*)), is computed.  */

comment|/* This routine is called when an AND of a term with a tree of AND's is    encountered.  If the term or its complement is present in the tree, it    can be replaced with TRUE or FALSE, respectively.     Note that (eq_attr "att" "v1") and (eq_attr "att" "v2") cannot both    be true and hence are complementary.     There is one special case:  If we see 	(and (not (eq_attr "att" "v1")) 	     (eq_attr "att" "v2"))    this can be replaced by (eq_attr "att" "v2").  To do this we need to    replace the term, not anything in the AND tree.  So we pass a pointer to    the term.  */

We can write as many as three subroutines.  `eligible_for_delay'    handles normal delay slots, `eligible_for_annul_true' indicates that    the specified insn can be annulled if the branch is true, and likewise    for `eligible_for_annul_false'.
