The C++ front end relies on TYPE_MAIN_VARIANT of a cv-qualified      array type being the unqualified version of that type.      Therefore, if we are constructing an array of const char, we must      construct the matching unqualified array type first.

If this    expression or its only operand forces a sequence point, then everything up    to the sequence point is stored in PBEFORE_SP.  Everything else gets stored    in PNO_SP.    Once we return, we will have emitted warnings if any subexpression before    such a sequence point could be undefined.  On a higher level, however, the    sequence point may not be relevant, and we'll merge the two lists.     Example: (b++, a) + b;    The call that processes the COMPOUND_EXPR will store the increment of B    in PBEFORE_SP, and the use of A in PNO_SP.  The higher-level call that    processes the PLUS_EXPR will need to merge the two lists so that    eventually, all accesses end up on the same list (and we'll warn about the    unordered subexpressions b++ and b.     A note on merging.  If we modify the former example so that our expression    becomes      (b++, b) + a    care must be taken not simply to add all three expressions into the final    PNO_SP list.  The function merge_tlist takes care of that by merging the    before-SP list of the COMPOUND_EXPR into its after-SP list in a special    way, so that no more than one access to B is recorded.  */

TYPE is the promoted type of the testing expression, and ORIG_TYPE is    the type before promoting it.  CASE_LOW_P is a pointer to the lower    bound of the case label, and CASE_HIGH_P is the upper bound or NULL    if the case is not a case range.    The caller has to make sure that we are not called with NULL for    CASE_LOW_P (i.e. the default case).    Returns true if the case label is in range of ORIG_TYPE (saturated or    untouched) or false if the label is out of range.  */

If we change modes, we may      wind up with bad conversions.  For INTEGER_TYPEs in C, must check      the precision as well, so as to yield correct results for      bit-field types.  C++ does not have these separate bit-field      types, and producing a signed or unsigned variant of an      ENUMERAL_TYPE may cause other problems as well.  */

Or else truncate the constant now      rather than extend the variable at run time.       This is only interesting if the constant is the wider arg.      Also, it is not safe if the constant is unsigned and the      variable arg is signed, since in this case the variable      would be sign-extended and then regarded as unsigned.      Our technique fails in this case because the lowest/highest      possible unsigned results don't follow naturally from the      lowest/highest possible values of the variable operand.      For just EQ_EXPR and NE_EXPR there is another technique that      could be used: see if the constant can be faithfully represented      in the other operand's type, by truncating it and reextending it      and see if that preserves the constant's value.  */

So, we have to pick a canonical 	 representative.  We do this below.  	 Technically, this approach is actually more conservative that 	 it needs to be.  In particular, `const int *' and `int *' 	 should be in different alias sets, according to the C and C++ 	 standard, since their types are not the same, and so, 	 technically, an `int **' and `const int **' cannot point at 	 the same thing.  	 But, the standard is wrong.  In particular, this code is 	 legal C++:  	    int *ip; 	    int **ipp =&ip; 	    const int* const* cipp = ipp;  	 And, it doesn't make sense for that to be legal unless you 	 can dereference IPP and CIPP.  So, we ignore cv-qualifiers on 	 the pointed-to types.  This issue has been reported to the 	 C++ committee.  */
