comment|/* TODO    - reordering of memory allocation and freeing to be more space efficient    - do rough calc of how many regs are needed in each block, and a rough      calc of how many regs are available in each class and use that to      throttle back the code in cases where RTX_COST is minimal.    - dead store elimination    - a store to the same address as a load does not kill the load if the      source of the store is also the destination of the load.  Handling this      allows more load motion, particularly out of loops.    - ability to realloc sbitmap vectors would allow one initial computation      of reg_set_in_block with only subsequent additions, rather than      recomputing it for each pass  */

Originally this tended to create worse overall code, but several    improvements during the development of PRE seem to have made following    back edges generally a win.     Note much of the loop invariant code motion done here would normally    be done by loop.c, which has more heuristics for when to move invariants    out of loops.

comment|/* We support GCSE via Partial Redundancy Elimination.  PRE optimizations    are a superset of those done by GCSE.     We perform the following steps:     1) Compute basic block information.     2) Compute table of places where registers are set.     3) Perform copy/constant propagation.     4) Perform global cse.     5) Perform another pass of copy/constant propagation.     Two passes of copy/constant propagation are done because the first one    enables more GCSE and the second one helps to clean up the copies that    GCSE creates.  This is needed more for PRE than for Classic because Classic    GCSE will try to use an existing register containing the common    subexpression rather than create a new one.  This is harder to do for PRE    because of the code motion (which Classic GCSE doesn't do).     Expressions we are interested in GCSE-ing are of the form    (set (pseudo-reg) (expression)).    Function want_to_gcse_p says what these are.     PRE handles moving invariant expressions out of loops (by treating them as    partially redundant).     Eventually it would be nice to replace cse.c/gcse.c with SSA (static single    assignment) based GVN (global value numbering).  L. T. Simpson's paper    (Rice University) on value numbering is a useful reference for this.     **********************     We used to support multiple passes but there are diminishing returns in    doing so.  The first pass usually makes 90% of the changes that are doable.    A second pass can make a few more changes made possible by the first pass.    Experiments show any further passes don't make enough changes to justify    the expense.     A study of spec92 using an unlimited number of passes:    [1 pass] = 1208 substitutions, [2] = 577, [3] = 202, [4] = 192, [5] = 83,    [6] = 34, [7] = 17, [8] = 9, [9] = 4, [10] = 4, [11] = 2,    [12] = 2, [13] = 1, [15] = 1, [16] = 2, [41] = 1     It was found doing copy propagation between each pass enables further    substitutions.     PRE is quite expensive in complicated functions because the DFA can take    awhile to converge.  Hence we only perform one pass.  Macro MAX_PASSES can    be modified if one wants to experiment.     **********************     The steps for PRE are:     1) Build the hash table of expressions we wish to GCSE (expr_hash_table).     2) Perform the data flow analysis for PRE.     3) Delete the redundant instructions     4) Insert the required copies [if any] that make the partially       redundant instructions fully redundant.     5) For other reaching expressions, insert an instruction to copy the value       to a newly created pseudo that will reach the redundant instruction.     The deletion is done first so that when we do insertions we    know which pseudo reg to use.     Various papers have argued that PRE DFA is expensive (O(n^2)) and others    argue it is not.  The number of iterations for the algorithm to converge    is typically 2-4 so I don't view it as that expensive (relatively speaking).     PRE GCSE depends heavily on the second CSE pass to clean up the copies    we create.  To make an expression reach the place where it's redundant,    the result of the expression is copied to a new register, and the redundant    expression is deleted by replacing it with this new register.  Classic GCSE    doesn't have this problem as much as it computes the reaching defs of    each register in each block and thus can try to use an existing register.     **********************     A fair bit of simplicity is created by creating small functions for simple    tasks, even when the function is only called in one place.  This may    measurably slow things down [or may not] by creating more function call    overhead than is necessary.  The source is laid out so that it's trivial    to make the affected functions inline so that one can measure what speed    up, if any, can be achieved, and maybe later when things settle things can    be rearranged.     Help stamp out big monolithic functions!  */

PRE GCSE only    requires knowledge of which blocks kill which regs [and thus could use    a bitmap instead of the lists `reg_set_table' uses].     `reg_set_table' and could be turned into an array of bitmaps    (num-bbs x num-regs)    [however perhaps it may be useful to keep the data as is].    One advantage of recording things this way is that `reg_set_table' is    fairly sparse with respect to pseudo regs but for hard regs could be    fairly dense [relatively speaking].    And recording sets of pseudo-regs in lists speeds    up functions like compute_transp since in the case of pseudo-regs we only    need to iterate over the number of times a pseudo-reg is set, not over the    number of basic blocks [clearly there is a bit of a slow down in the cases    where a pseudo is set more than once in a block, however it is believed    that the net effect is to speed things up].  This isn't done for hard-regs    because recording call-clobbered hard-regs in `reg_set_table' at each    function call can consume a fair bit of memory, and iterating over hard-regs    stored this way in compute_transp will be more expensive.  */

An expression is transparent in a block if its operands are not modified    in the block.     An expression is computed (locally available) in a block if it is computed    at least once and expression would contain the same value if the    computation was moved to the end of the block.     An expression is locally anticipatable in a block if it is computed at    least once and expression would contain the same value if the computation    was moved to the beginning of the block.     We call this routine for cprop, pre and code hoisting.  They all    compute basically the same information and thus can easily share    this code.     TRANSP, COMP, and ANTLOC are destination sbitmaps for recording    local properties.  If NULL, then it is not necessary to compute    or record that particular property.     SETP controls which hash table to look at.  If zero, this routine    looks at the expr hash table; if nonzero this routine looks at    the set hash table.  Additionally, TRANSP is computed as ~TRANSP,    since this is really cprop's ABSALTERED.  */

We want to do this when there are two computations    of the expression in the block.     VISITED is a pointer to a working buffer for tracking which BB's have    been visited.  It is NULL for the top-level call.     We treat reaching expressions that go through blocks containing the same    reaching expression as "not reaching".  E.g. if EXPR is generated in blocks    2 and 3, INSN is in block 4, and 2->3->4, we treat the expression in block    2 as not reaching.  The intent is to improve the probability of finding    only one reaching expression and to reduce register lifetimes by picking    the closest such expression.  */

We treat reaching expressions that go through blocks containing the same    reaching expression as "not reaching".  E.g. if EXPR is generated in blocks    2 and 3, INSN is in block 4, and 2->3->4, we treat the expression in block    2 as not reaching.  The intent is to improve the probability of finding    only one reaching expression and to reduce register lifetimes by picking    the closest such expression.  */

This is based on the original Morel-Renvoise paper Fred Chow's thesis,    and lazy code motion from Knoop, Ruthing and Steffen as described in    Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation.     ??? A new pseudo reg is created to hold the reaching expression.    The nice thing about the classical approach is that it would try to    use an existing reg.  If the register can't be adequately optimized    [i.e. we introduce reload problems], one could add a pass here to    propagate the new register through the block.     ??? We don't handle single sets in PARALLELs because we're [currently]    not able to copy the rest of the parallel when we insert copies to create    full redundancies from partial redundancies.  However, there's no reason    why we can't handle PARALLELs in the cases where there are no partial    redundancies.  */

comment|/* Compute transparent outgoing information for each block.     An expression is transparent to an edge unless it is killed by    the edge itself.  This can only happen with abnormal control flow,    when the edge is traversed through a call.  This happens with    non-local labels and exceptions.     This would not be necessary if we split the edge.  While this is    normally impossible for abnormal critical edges, with some effort    it should be possible with exception handling, since we still have    control over which handler should be invoked.  But due to increased    EH table sizes, this may not be worthwhile.  */
