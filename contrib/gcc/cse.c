comment|/* The basic idea of common subexpression elimination is to go    through the code, keeping a record of expressions that would    have the same value at the current scan point, and replacing    expressions encountered with the cheapest equivalent expression.     It is too complicated to keep track of the different possibilities    when control paths merge in this code; so, at each label, we forget all    that is known and start fresh.  This can be described as processing each    extended basic block separately.  We have a separate pass to perform    global CSE.     Note CSE can turn a conditional or computed jump into a nop or    an unconditional jump.  When this occurs we arrange to run the jump    optimizer after CSE to delete the unreachable code.     We use two data structures to record the equivalent expressions:    a hash table for most expressions, and a vector of "quantity    numbers" to record equivalent (pseudo) registers.     The use of the special data structure for registers is desirable    because it is faster.  It is possible because registers references    contain a fairly small number, the register number, taken from    a contiguously allocated series, and two register references are    identical if they have the same number.  General expressions    do not have any such thing, so the only way to retrieve the    information recorded on an expression other than a register    is to keep it in a hash table.  Registers and "quantity numbers":     At the start of each basic block, all of the (hardware and pseudo)    registers used in the function are given distinct quantity    numbers to indicate their contents.  During scan, when the code    copies one register into another, we copy the quantity number.    When a register is loaded in any other way, we allocate a new    quantity number to describe the value generated by this operation.    `reg_qty' records what quantity a register is currently thought    of as containing.     All real quantity numbers are greater than or equal to `max_reg'.    If register N has not been assigned a quantity, reg_qty[N] will equal N.     Quantity numbers below `max_reg' do not exist and none of the `qty_table'    entries should be referenced with an index below `max_reg'.     We also maintain a bidirectional chain of registers for each    quantity number.  The `qty_table` members `first_reg' and `last_reg',    and `reg_eqv_table' members `next' and `prev' hold these chains.     The first register in a chain is the one whose lifespan is least local.    Among equals, it is the one that was seen first.    We replace any equivalent register with that one.     If two registers have the same quantity number, it must be true that    REG expressions with qty_table `mode' must be in the hash table for both    registers and must be in the same class.     The converse is not true.  Since hard registers may be referenced in    any mode, two REG expressions might be equivalent in the hash table    but not have the same quantity number if the quantity number of one    of the registers is not the same mode as those expressions.  Constants and quantity numbers     When a quantity has a known constant value, that value is stored    in the appropriate qty_table `const_rtx'.  This is in addition to    putting the constant in the hash table as is usual for non-regs.     Whether a reg or a constant is preferred is determined by the configuration    macro CONST_COSTS and will often depend on the constant value.  In any    event, expressions containing constants can be simplified, by fold_rtx.     When a quantity has a known nearly constant value (such as an address    of a stack slot), that value is stored in the appropriate qty_table    `const_rtx'.     Integer constants don't have a machine mode.  However, cse    determines the intended machine mode from the destination    of the instruction that moves the constant.  The machine mode    is recorded in the hash table along with the actual RTL    constant expression so that different modes are kept separate.  Other expressions:     To record known equivalences among expressions in general    we use a hash table called `table'.  It has a fixed number of buckets    that contain chains of `struct table_elt' elements for expressions.    These chains connect the elements whose expressions have the same    hash codes.     Other chains through the same elements connect the elements which    currently have equivalent values.     Register references in an expression are canonicalized before hashing    the expression.  This is done using `reg_qty' and qty_table `first_reg'.    The hash code of a register reference is computed using the quantity    number, not the register number.     When the value of an expression changes, it is necessary to remove from the    hash table not just that expression but all expressions whose values    could be different as a result.       1. If the value changing is in memory, except in special cases      ANYTHING referring to memory could be changed.  That is because      nobody knows where a pointer does not point.      The function `invalidate_memory' removes what is necessary.       The special cases are when the address is constant or is      a constant plus a fixed register such as the frame pointer      or a static chain pointer.  When such addresses are stored in,      we can tell exactly which other such addresses must be invalidated      due to overlap.  `invalidate' does this.      All expressions that refer to non-constant      memory addresses are also invalidated.  `invalidate_memory' does this.       2. If the value changing is a register, all expressions      containing references to that register, and only those,      must be removed.     Because searching the entire hash table for expressions that contain    a register is very slow, we try to figure out when it isn't necessary.    Precisely, this is necessary only when expressions have been    entered in the hash table using this register, and then the value has    changed, and then another expression wants to be added to refer to    the register's new value.  This sequence of circumstances is rare    within any one basic block.     The vectors `reg_tick' and `reg_in_table' are used to detect this case.    reg_tick[i] is incremented whenever a value is stored in register i.    reg_in_table[i] holds -1 if no references to register i have been    entered in the table; otherwise, it contains the value reg_tick[i] had    when the references were entered.  If we want to enter a reference    and reg_in_table[i] != reg_tick[i], we must scan and remove old references.    Until we want to enter a new entry, the mere fact that the two vectors    don't match makes the entries be ignored if anyone tries to match them.     Registers themselves are entered in the hash table as well as in    the equivalent-register chains.  However, the vectors `reg_tick'    and `reg_in_table' do not apply to expressions which are simple    register references.  These expressions are removed from the table    immediately when they become invalid, and this can be done even if    we do not immediately search for all the expressions that refer to    the register.     A CLOBBER rtx in an instruction invalidates its operand for further    reuse.  A CLOBBER or SET rtx whose operand is a MEM:BLK    invalidates everything that resides in memory.  Related expressions:     Constant expressions that differ only by an additive integer    are called related.  When a constant expression is put in    the table, the related expression with no constant term    is also entered.  These are made to point at each other    so that it is possible to find out if there exists any    register equivalent to an expression related to a given expression.  */

Those elements with the same hash code are chained in both directions    through the `next_same_hash' and `prev_same_hash' fields.     Each set of expressions with equivalent values    are on a two-way chain through the `next_same_value'    and `prev_same_value' fields, and all point with    the `first_same_value' field at the first element in    that chain.  The chain is in order of increasing cost.    Each element's cost value is in its `cost' field.     The `in_memory' field is nonzero for elements that    involve any reference to memory.  These elements are removed    whenever a write is done to an unidentified location in memory.    To be safe, we assume that a memory address is unidentified unless    the address is either a symbol constant or a constant plus    the frame pointer or argument pointer.     The `related_value' field is used to connect related expressions    (that differ by adding an integer).    The related expressions are chained in a circular fashion.    `related_value' is zero for expressions for which this    chain is not useful.     The `cost' field stores the cost of this element's expression.    The `regcost' field stores the value returned by approx_reg_cost for    this element's expression.     The `is_const' flag is set if the element is a constant (including    a fixed address).     The `flag' field is used as a temporary during some search routines.     The `mode' field is usually the same as GET_MODE (`exp'), but    if `exp' is a CONST_INT and has no machine mode then the `mode'    field is the mode it was being used as.

It is inserted at the proper position to keep the class in    the order cheapest first.     MODE is the machine-mode of X, or if X is an integer constant    with VOIDmode then MODE is the mode with which X will be used.     For elements of equal cheapness, the most recent one    goes in front, except that the first element in the list    remains first unless a cheaper element is added.  The order of    pseudo-registers does not matter, as canon_reg will be called to    find the cheapest when a register is retrieved from the table.     The in_memory field in the hash table element is set to 0.    The caller must set it nonzero if appropriate.     You should call insert_regs (X, CLASSP, MODIFY) before calling here,    and if insert_regs returns a nonzero value    you must then recompute its hash code before calling here.     If necessary, update table showing constant values of quantities.  */

If VALIDATE is nonzero,    we assume X is an expression being processed from the rtl    and Y was found in the hash table.  We check register refs    in Y for being marked as valid.     If EQUAL_VALUES is nonzero, we allow a register to match a constant value    that is known to be in the register.  Ordinarily, we don't allow them    to match, because letting them match would cause unpredictable results    in all the places that search a hash table chain for an equivalent    for a given value.  A possible equivalent that has different structure    has its hash code computed from different data.  Whether the hash code    is the same as that of the given value is pure luck.  */

If INSN is non-zero and we are replacing a pseudo with a hard register    or vice versa, validate_change is used to ensure that INSN remains valid    after we make our substitution.  The calls are made with IN_GROUP non-zero    so apply_change_group must be called upon the outermost return from this    function (unless INSN is zero).  The result of apply_change_group can    generally be discarded since the changes we are making are optional.  */

comment|/* LOC is a location within INSN that is an operand address (the contents of    a MEM).  Find the best equivalent address to use that is valid for this    insn.     On most CISC machines, complicated address modes are costly, and rtx_cost    is a good approximation for that cost.  However, most RISC machines have    only a few (usually only one) memory reference formats.  If an address is    valid at all, it is often just as cheap as any other address.  Hence, for    RISC machines, we use the configuration macro `ADDRESS_COST' to compare the    costs of various addresses.  For two addresses of equal cost, choose the one    with the highest `rtx_cost' value as that has the potential of eliminating    the most insns.  For equal costs, we choose the first in the equivalence    class.  Note that we ignore the fact that pseudo registers are cheaper    than hard registers here because we would also prefer the pseudo registers.   */

These MEM expressions are made only once and inserted      in many instructions, as well as being used to control symbol table      output.  It is not safe to clobber them.       There are some uncommon cases where the address is already in a register      for some reason, but we cannot take advantage of that because we have      no easy way to unshare the MEM.

Then try to simplify before checking for      the best address to use.  This catches a few cases:  First is when we      have REG+const and the register is another REG+const.  We can often merge      the constants and eliminate one insn and one register.  It may also be      that a machine has a cheap REG+REG+const.

But we can find an equivalence for this SUBREG 	 by folding that operation is the narrow mode.  This allows us to 	 fold arithmetic in narrow modes when the machine only supports 	 word-sized arithmetic.  	 Also look for a case where we have a SUBREG whose operand is the 	 same as our result.  If both modes are smaller than a word, we 	 are simply interpreting a register in different modes and we 	 can use the inner value.  */

Also do not do this if we are operating on a copy of INSN.

Some uses of REG_EQUIV might rely on it 	     being attached to REG1 rather than REG2.  	     This section previously turned the REG_EQUIV into a REG_EQUAL 	     note.

Often we have a loop where an expression in the exit test is used    in the body of the loop.  For example "while (*p) *q++ = *p++;".    Because of the way we duplicate the loop exit test in front of the loop,    however, we don't detect that common subexpression.  This will be caught    when global cse is implemented, but this is a quite common case.     This function handles the most common cases of these common expressions.    It is called after we have processed the basic block ending with the    NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END note that ends a loop and the previous JUMP_INSN    jumps to a label used only once.  */

comment|/* Process insns starting after LOOP_START until we hit a CALL_INSN or      a CODE_LABEL (we could handle a CALL_INSN, but it isn't worth it).       The only thing we do with SET_DEST is invalidate entries, so we      can safely process each SET in order.  It is slightly less efficient      to do so, but we only want to handle the most common cases.       The gen_move_insn call in cse_set_around_loop may create new pseudos.      These pseudos won't have valid entries in any of the tables indexed      by register number, such as reg_qty.  We avoid out-of-range array      accesses by not processing any instructions created after cse started.  */

If those two conditions are true, we search backwards from the start of    the loop to see if that same value was loaded into a register that still    retains its value at the start of the loop.     If so, we insert an insn after the load to copy the destination of that    load into the equivalent register and (try to) replace our SET_SRC with that    register.     In any event, we invalidate whatever this SET or CLOBBER modifies.  */

This is used to remove insns made obviously dead by cse, loop or other    optimizations.  It improves the heuristics in loop since it won't try to    move dead invariants out of loops or make givs for dead quantities.  The    remaining passes of the compilation are also sped up.  */
