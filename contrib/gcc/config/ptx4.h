comment|/* Provide an ASM_SPEC appropriate for svr4.  Here we try to support as    many of the specialized svr4 assembler options as seems reasonable,    given that there are certain options which we can't (or shouldn't)    support directly due to the fact that they conflict with other options     for other svr4 tools (e.g. ld) or with other options for GCC itself.    For example, we don't support the -o (output file) or -R (remove    input file) options because GCC already handles these things.  We    also don't support the -m (run m4) option for the assembler because    that conflicts with the -m (produce load map) option of the svr4    linker.  We do however allow passing arbitrary options to the svr4    assembler via the -Wa, option.     Note that gcc doesn't allow a space to follow -Y in a -Ym,* or -Yd,*    option. */

comment|/* svr4 assemblers need the `-' (indicating input from stdin) to come after    the -o option (and its argument) for some reason.  If we try to put it    before the -o option, the assembler will try to read the file named as    the output file in the -o option as an input file (after it has already    written some stuff to it) and the binary stuff contained therein will    cause totally confuse the assembler, resulting in many spurious error    messages.  */

Here we provide support    for the special GCC options -static, -shared, and -symbolic which    allow us to link things in one of these three modes by applying the    appropriate combinations of options at link-time.  We also provide    support here for as many of the other svr4 linker options as seems    reasonable, given that some of them conflict with options for other    svr4 tools (e.g. the assembler).  In particular, we do support the    -z*, -V, -b, -t, -Qy, -Qn, and -YP* options here, and the -e*,    -l*, -o*, -r, -s, -u*, and -L* options are directly supported    by gcc.c itself.  We don't directly support the -m (generate load    map) option because that conflicts with the -m (run m4) option of    the svr4 assembler.  We also don't directly support the svr4 linker's    -I* or -M* options because these conflict with existing GCC options.    We do however allow passing arbitrary options to the svr4 linker    via the -Wl, option.  We don't support the svr4 linker's -a option    at all because it is totally useless and because it conflicts with    GCC's own -a option.     Note that gcc doesn't allow a space to follow -Y in a -YP,* option.     When the -G link option is used (-shared and -symbolic) a final link is    not being done.  */

comment|/* Gcc automatically adds in one of the files /lib/values-Xc.o    or /lib/values-Xa.o, for each final link step (depending upon the other    gcc options selected, such as -ansi).  These files each contain one    (initialized) copy of a special variable called `_lib_version'.  Each    one of these files has `_lib_version' initialized to a different (enum)    value.  The SVR4 library routines query the value of `_lib_version'    at run to decide how they should behave.  Specifically, they decide    (based upon the value of `_lib_version') if they will act in a strictly    ANSI conforming manner or not. */
