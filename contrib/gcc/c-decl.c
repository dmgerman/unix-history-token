The whole point here is to end up with a situation where each 	 and every ..._TYPE node the compiler creates will be uniquely 	 associated with AT MOST one node representing a typedef name. 	 This way, even though the compiler substitutes corresponding 	 ..._TYPE nodes for TYPE_DECL (i.e. "typedef name") nodes very 	 early on, later parts of the compiler can always do the reverse 	 translation and get back the corresponding typedef name.  For 	 example, given:  		typedef struct S MY_TYPE; 		MY_TYPE object;  	 Later parts of the compiler might only know that `object' was of 	 type `struct S' if it were not for code just below.  With this 	 code however, later parts of the compiler see something like:  		struct S' == struct S 		typedef struct S' MY_TYPE; 		struct S' object;  	 And they can then deduce (from the node for type struct S') that 	 the original object declaration was:  		MY_TYPE object;  	 Being able to do this is important for proper support of protoize, 	 and also for generating precise symbolic debugging information 	 which takes full account of the programmer's (typedef) vocabulary.           Obviously, we don't want to generate a duplicate ..._TYPE node if 	 the TYPE_DECL node that we are now processing really represents a 	 standard built-in type.           Since all standard types are effectively declared at line zero          in the source file, we can easily check to see if we are working          on a standard type by checking the current value of lineno.  */

comment|/* Given declspecs and a declarator,    determine the name and type of the object declared    and construct a ..._DECL node for it.    (In one case we can return a ..._TYPE node instead.     For invalid input we sometimes return 0.)     DECLSPECS is a chain of tree_list nodes whose value fields     are the storage classes and type specifiers.     DECL_CONTEXT says which syntactic context this declaration is in:      NORMAL for most contexts.  Make a VAR_DECL or FUNCTION_DECL or TYPE_DECL.      FUNCDEF for a function definition.  Like NORMAL but a few different       error messages in each case.  Return value may be zero meaning       this definition is too screwy to try to parse.      PARM for a parameter declaration (either within a function prototype       or before a function body).  Make a PARM_DECL, or return void_type_node.      TYPENAME if for a typename (in a cast or sizeof).       Don't make a DECL node; just return the ..._TYPE node.      FIELD for a struct or union field; make a FIELD_DECL.      BITFIELD for a field with specified width.    INITIALIZED is 1 if the decl has an initializer.     In the TYPENAME case, DECLARATOR is really an absolute declarator.    It may also be so in the PARM case, for a prototype where the    argument type is specified but not the name.     This function is where the complicated C meanings of `static'    and `extern' are interpreted.  */

The argument is the value returned by `get_parm_info' (or made in parse.y    if there is an identifier list instead of a parameter decl list).    These two functions are separate because when a function returns    or receives functions then each is called multiple times but the order    of calls is different.  The last call to `grokparms' is always the one    that contains the formal parameter names of a function definition.     Store in `last_function_parms' a chain of the decls of parms.    Also store in `last_function_parm_tags' a chain of the struct, union,    and enum tags declared among the parms.     Return a list of arg types to use in the FUNCTION_TYPE for this function.     FUNCDEF_FLAG is nonzero for a function definition, 0 for    a mere declaration.  A nonempty identifier-list gets an error message    when FUNCDEF_FLAG is zero.  */

DECLSPECS, DECLARATOR, PREFIX_ATTRIBUTES and ATTRIBUTES are the parts of    the declaration; they describe the function's name and the type it returns,    but twisted together in a fashion that parallels the syntax of C.     This function creates a binding context for the function body    as well as setting up the FUNCTION_DECL in current_function_decl.     Returns 1 on success.  If the DECLARATOR is not suitable for a function    (it defines a datum instead), we return 0, which tells    yyparse to report a parse error.     NESTED is nonzero for a function nested within another function.  */
