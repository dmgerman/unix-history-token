comment|/* Allocation of hard register numbers to pseudo registers is done in    two passes.  In this pass we consider only regs that are born and    die once within one basic block.  We do this one basic block at a    time.  Then the next pass allocates the registers that remain.    Two passes are used because this pass uses methods that work only    on linear code, but that do a better job than the general methods    used in global_alloc, and more quickly too.     The assignments made are recorded in the vector reg_renumber    whose space is allocated here.  The rtl code itself is not altered.     We assign each instruction in the basic block a number    which is its order from the beginning of the block.    Then we can represent the lifetime of a pseudo register with    a pair of numbers, and check for conflicts easily.    We can record the availability of hard registers with a    HARD_REG_SET for each instruction.  The HARD_REG_SET    contains 0 or 1 for each hard reg.     To avoid register shuffling, we tie registers together when one    dies by being copied into another, or dies in an instruction that    does arithmetic to produce another.  The tied registers are    allocated as one.  Registers with different reg class preferences    can never be tied unless the class preferred by one is a subclass    of the one preferred by the other.     Tying is represented with "quantity numbers".    A non-tied register is given a new quantity number.    Tied registers have the same quantity number.     We have provision to exempt registers, even when they are contained    within the block, that can be tied to others that are not contained in it.    This is so that global_alloc could process them both and tie them then.    But this is currently disabled since tying in global_alloc is not    yet implemented.  */

Combining registers means marking them as having the same quantity    and adjusting the offsets within the quantity if either of    them is a SUBREG).     We don't actually combine a hard reg with a pseudo; instead    we just record the hard reg as the suggestion for the pseudo's quantity.    If we really combined them, we could lose if the pseudo lives    across an insn that clobbers the hard reg (eg, movstr).     ALREADY_DEAD is non-zero if USEDREG is known to be dead even though    there is no REG_DEAD note on INSN.  This occurs during the processing    of REG_NO_CONFLICT blocks.     MAY_SAVE_COPYCOPY is non-zero if this insn is simply copying USEDREG to    SETREG or if the input and output must share a register.    In that case, we record a hard reg suggestion in QTY_PHYS_COPY_SUGG.     There are elaborate checks for the validity of combining.  */
