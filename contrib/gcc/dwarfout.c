comment|/*   Notes on the GNU Implementation of DWARF Debugging Information  --------------------------------------------------------------  Last Major Update: Sun Jul 17 08:17:42 PDT 1994 by rfg@segfault.us.com  ------------------------------------------------------------   This file describes special and unique aspects of the GNU implementation of  the DWARF Version 1 debugging information language, as provided in the GNU  version 2.x compiler(s).   For general information about the DWARF debugging information language,  you should obtain the DWARF version 1.1 specification document (and perhaps  also the DWARF version 2 draft specification document) developed by the  (now defunct) UNIX International Programming Languages Special Interest Group.   To obtain a copy of the DWARF Version 1 and/or DWARF Version 2  specification, visit the web page for the DWARF Version 2 committee, at     http://www.eagercon.com/dwarf/dwarf2std.htm   The generation of DWARF debugging information by the GNU version 2.x C  compiler has now been tested rather extensively for m88k, i386, i860, and  Sparc targets.  The DWARF output of the GNU C compiler appears to inter-  operate well with the standard SVR4 SDB debugger on these kinds of target  systems (but of course, there are no guarantees).   DWARF 1 generation for the GNU g++ compiler is implemented, but limited.  C++ users should definitely use DWARF 2 instead.   Future plans for the dwarfout.c module of the GNU compiler(s) includes the  addition of full support for GNU FORTRAN.  (This should, in theory, be a  lot simpler to add than adding support for g++... but we'll see.)   Many features of the DWARF version 2 specification have been adapted to  (and used in) the GNU implementation of DWARF (version 1).  In most of  these cases, a DWARF version 2 approach is used in place of (or in addition  to) DWARF version 1 stuff simply because it is apparent that DWARF version  1 is not sufficiently expressive to provide the kinds of information which  may be necessary to support really robust debugging.  In all of these cases  however, the use of DWARF version 2 features should not interfere in any  way with the interoperability (of GNU compilers) with generally available  "classic" (pre version 1) DWARF consumer tools (e.g. SVR4 SDB).   The DWARF generation enhancement for the GNU compiler(s) was initially  donated to the Free Software Foundation by Network Computing Devices.  (Thanks NCD!) Additional development and maintenance of dwarfout.c has  been largely supported (i.e. funded) by Intel Corporation.  (Thanks Intel!)   If you have questions or comments about the DWARF generation feature, please  send mail to me<rfg@netcom.com>.  I will be happy to investigate any bugs  reported and I may even provide fixes (but of course, I can make no promises).   The DWARF debugging information produced by GCC may deviate in a few minor  (but perhaps significant) respects from the DWARF debugging information  currently produced by other C compilers.  A serious attempt has been made  however to conform to the published specifications, to existing practice,  and to generally accepted norms in the GNU implementation of DWARF.       ** IMPORTANT NOTE **    ** IMPORTANT NOTE **    ** IMPORTANT NOTE **   Under normal circumstances, the DWARF information generated by the GNU  compilers (in an assembly language file) is essentially impossible for  a human being to read.  This fact can make it very difficult to debug  certain DWARF-related problems.  In order to overcome this difficulty,  a feature has been added to dwarfout.c (enabled by the -dA  option) which causes additional comments to be placed into the assembly  language output file, out to the right-hand side of most bits of DWARF  material.  The comments indicate (far more clearly that the obscure  DWARF hex codes do) what is actually being encoded in DWARF.  Thus, the  -dA option can be highly useful for those who must study the  DWARF output from the GNU compilers in detail.   ---------   (Footnote: Within this file, the term `Debugging Information Entry' will  be abbreviated as `DIE'.)    Release Notes  (aka known bugs)  -------------------------------   In one very obscure case involving dynamically sized arrays, the DWARF  "location information" for such an array may make it appear that the  array has been totally optimized out of existence, when in fact it  *must* actually exist.  (This only happens when you are using *both* -g  *and* -O.)  This is due to aggressive dead store elimination in the  compiler, and to the fact that the DECL_RTL expressions associated with  variables are not always updated to correctly reflect the effects of  GCC's aggressive dead store elimination.   -------------------------------   When attempting to set a breakpoint at the "start" of a function compiled  with -g1, the debugger currently has no way of knowing exactly where the  end of the prologue code for the function is.  Thus, for most targets,  all the debugger can do is to set the breakpoint at the AT_low_pc address  for the function.  But if you stop there and then try to look at one or  more of the formal parameter values, they may not have been "homed" yet,  so you may get inaccurate answers (or perhaps even addressing errors).   Some people may consider this simply a non-feature, but I consider it a  bug, and I hope to provide some GNU-specific attributes (on function  DIEs) which will specify the address of the end of the prologue and the  address of the beginning of the epilogue in a future release.   -------------------------------   It is believed at this time that old bugs relating to the AT_bit_offset  values for bit-fields have been fixed.   There may still be some very obscure bugs relating to the DWARF description  of type `long long' bit-fields for target machines (e.g. 80x86 machines)  where the alignment of type `long long' data objects is different from  (and less than) the size of a type `long long' data object.   Please report any problems with the DWARF description of bit-fields as you  would any other GCC bug.  (Procedures for bug reporting are given in the  GNU C compiler manual.)   --------------------------------   At this time, GCC does not know how to handle the GNU C "nested functions"  extension.  (See the GCC manual for more info on this extension to ANSI C.)   --------------------------------   The GNU compilers now represent inline functions (and inlined instances  thereof) in exactly the manner described by the current DWARF version 2  (draft) specification.  The version 1 specification for handling inline  functions (and inlined instances) was known to be brain-damaged (by the  PLSIG) when the version 1 spec was finalized, but it was simply too late  in the cycle to get it removed before the version 1 spec was formally  released to the public (by UI).   --------------------------------   At this time, GCC does not generate the kind of really precise information  about the exact declared types of entities with signed integral types which  is required by the current DWARF draft specification.   Specifically, the current DWARF draft specification seems to require that  the type of an non-unsigned integral bit-field member of a struct or union  type be represented as either a "signed" type or as a "plain" type,  depending upon the exact set of keywords that were used in the  type specification for the given bit-field member.  It was felt (by the  UI/PLSIG) that this distinction between "plain" and "signed" integral types  could have some significance (in the case of bit-fields) because ANSI C  does not constrain the signedness of a plain bit-field, whereas it does  constrain the signedness of an explicitly "signed" bit-field.  For this  reason, the current DWARF specification calls for compilers to produce  type information (for *all* integral typed entities... not just bit-fields)  which explicitly indicates the signedness of the relevant type to be  "signed" or "plain" or "unsigned".   Unfortunately, the GNU DWARF implementation is currently incapable of making  such distinctions.   --------------------------------    Known Interoperability Problems  -------------------------------   Although the GNU implementation of DWARF conforms (for the most part) with  the current UI/PLSIG DWARF version 1 specification (with many compatible  version 2 features added in as "vendor specific extensions" just for good  measure) there are a few known cases where GCC's DWARF output can cause  some confusion for "classic" (pre version 1) DWARF consumers such as the  System V Release 4 SDB debugger.  These cases are described in this section.   --------------------------------   The DWARF version 1 specification includes the fundamental type codes  FT_ext_prec_float, FT_complex, FT_dbl_prec_complex, and FT_ext_prec_complex.  Since GNU C is only a C compiler (and since C doesn't provide any "complex"  data types) the only one of these fundamental type codes which GCC ever  generates is FT_ext_prec_float.  This fundamental type code is generated  by GCC for the `long double' data type.  Unfortunately, due to an apparent  bug in the SVR4 SDB debugger, SDB can become very confused wherever any  attempt is made to print a variable, parameter, or field whose type was  given in terms of FT_ext_prec_float.   (Actually, SVR4 SDB fails to understand *any* of the four fundamental type  codes mentioned here.  This will fact will cause additional problems when  there is a GNU FORTRAN front-end.)   --------------------------------   In general, it appears that SVR4 SDB is not able to effectively ignore  fundamental type codes in the "implementation defined" range.  This can  cause problems when a program being debugged uses the `long long' data  type (or the signed or unsigned varieties thereof) because these types  are not defined by ANSI C, and thus, GCC must use its own private fundamental  type codes (from the implementation-defined range) to represent these types.   --------------------------------    General GNU DWARF extensions  ----------------------------   In the current DWARF version 1 specification, no mechanism is specified by  which accurate information about executable code from include files can be  properly (and fully) described.  (The DWARF version 2 specification *does*  specify such a mechanism, but it is about 10 times more complicated than  it needs to be so I'm not terribly anxious to try to implement it right  away.)   In the GNU implementation of DWARF version 1, a fully downward-compatible  extension has been implemented which permits the GNU compilers to specify  which executable lines come from which files.  This extension places  additional information (about source file names) in GNU-specific sections  (which should be totally ignored by all non-GNU DWARF consumers) so that  this extended information can be provided (to GNU DWARF consumers) in a way  which is totally transparent (and invisible) to non-GNU DWARF consumers  (e.g. the SVR4 SDB debugger).  The additional information is placed *only*  in specialized GNU-specific sections, where it should never even be seen  by non-GNU DWARF consumers.   To understand this GNU DWARF extension, imagine that the sequence of entries  in the .lines section is broken up into several subsections.  Each contiguous  sequence of .line entries which relates to a sequence of lines (or statements)  from one particular file (either a `base' file or an `include' file) could  be called a `line entries chunk' (LEC).   For each LEC there is one entry in the .debug_srcinfo section.   Each normal entry in the .debug_srcinfo section consists of two 4-byte  words of data as follows:  	 (1)	The starting address (relative to the entire .line section) 		 of the first .line entry in the relevant LEC.  	 (2)	The starting address (relative to the entire .debug_sfnames 		 section) of a NUL terminated string representing the 		 relevant filename.  (This filename name be either a 		 relative or an absolute filename, depending upon how the 		 given source file was located during compilation.)   Obviously, each .debug_srcinfo entry allows you to find the relevant filename,  and it also points you to the first .line entry that was generated as a result  of having compiled a given source line from the given source file.   Each subsequent .line entry should also be assumed to have been produced  as a result of compiling yet more lines from the same file.  The end of  any given LEC is easily found by looking at the first 4-byte pointer in  the *next* .debug_srcinfo entry.  That next .debug_srcinfo entry points  to a new and different LEC, so the preceding LEC (implicitly) must have  ended with the last .line section entry which occurs at the 2 1/2 words  just before the address given in the first pointer of the new .debug_srcinfo  entry.   The following picture may help to clarify this feature.  Let's assume that  `LE' stands for `.line entry'.  Also, assume that `* 'stands for a pointer.   	 .line section	   .debug_srcinfo section     .debug_sfnames section 	 ----------------------------------------------------------------  	 LE<---------------------- * 	 LE			    * -----------------> "foobar.c"<--- 	 LE								| 	 LE								| 	 LE<---------------------- *					| 	 LE			    * -----------------> "foobar.h"<|	| 	 LE							     |	| 	 LE							     |	| 	 LE<---------------------- *				     |	| 	 LE			    * ----------------->  "inner.h"  |	| 	 LE							     |	| 	 LE<---------------------- *				     |	| 	 LE			    * -------------------------------	| 	 LE								| 	 LE								| 	 LE								| 	 LE								| 	 LE<---------------------- *					| 	 LE			    * ----------------------------------- 	 LE 	 LE 	 LE   In effect, each entry in the .debug_srcinfo section points to *both* a  filename (in the .debug_sfnames section) and to the start of a block of  consecutive LEs (in the .line section).   Note that just like in the .line section, there are specialized first and  last entries in the .debug_srcinfo section for each object file.  These  special first and last entries for the .debug_srcinfo section are very  different from the normal .debug_srcinfo section entries.  They provide  additional information which may be helpful to a debugger when it is  interpreting the data in the .debug_srcinfo, .debug_sfnames, and .line  sections.   The first entry in the .debug_srcinfo section for each compilation unit  consists of five 4-byte words of data.  The contents of these five words  should be interpreted (by debuggers) as follows:  	 (1)	The starting address (relative to the entire .line section) 		 of the .line section for this compilation unit.  	 (2)	The starting address (relative to the entire .debug_sfnames 		 section) of the .debug_sfnames section for this compilation 		 unit.  	 (3)	The starting address (in the execution virtual address space) 		 of the .text section for this compilation unit.  	 (4)	The ending address plus one (in the execution virtual address 		 space) of the .text section for this compilation unit.  	 (5)	The date/time (in seconds since midnight 1/1/70) at which the 		 compilation of this compilation unit occurred.  This value 		 should be interpreted as an unsigned quantity because gcc 		 might be configured to generate a default value of 0xffffffff 		 in this field (in cases where it is desired to have object 		 files created at different times from identical source files 		 be byte-for-byte identical).  By default, these timestamps 		 are *not* generated by dwarfout.c (so that object files 		 compiled at different times will be byte-for-byte identical). 		 If you wish to enable this "timestamp" feature however, you 		 can simply place a #define for the symbol `DWARF_TIMESTAMPS' 		 in your target configuration file and then rebuild the GNU 		 compiler(s).   Note that the first string placed into the .debug_sfnames section for each  compilation unit is the name of the directory in which compilation occurred.  This string ends with a `/' (to help indicate that it is the pathname of a  directory).  Thus, the second word of each specialized initial .debug_srcinfo  entry for each compilation unit may be used as a pointer to the (string)  name of the compilation directory, and that string may in turn be used to  "absolutize" any relative pathnames which may appear later on in the  .debug_sfnames section entries for the same compilation unit.   The fifth and last word of each specialized starting entry for a compilation  unit in the .debug_srcinfo section may (depending upon your configuration)  indicate the date/time of compilation, and this may be used (by a debugger)  to determine if any of the source files which contributed code to this  compilation unit are newer than the object code for the compilation unit  itself.  If so, the debugger may wish to print an "out-of-date" warning  about the compilation unit.   The .debug_srcinfo section associated with each compilation will also have  a specialized terminating entry.  This terminating .debug_srcinfo section  entry will consist of the following two 4-byte words of data:  	 (1)	The offset, measured from the start of the .line section to 		 the beginning of the terminating entry for the .line section.  	 (2)	A word containing the value 0xffffffff.   --------------------------------   In the current DWARF version 1 specification, no mechanism is specified by  which information about macro definitions and un-definitions may be provided  to the DWARF consumer.   The DWARF version 2 (draft) specification does specify such a mechanism.  That specification was based on the GNU ("vendor specific extension")  which provided some support for macro definitions and un-definitions,  but the "official" DWARF version 2 (draft) specification mechanism for  handling macros and the GNU implementation have diverged somewhat.  I  plan to update the GNU implementation to conform to the "official"  DWARF version 2 (draft) specification as soon as I get time to do that.   Note that in the GNU implementation, additional information about macro  definitions and un-definitions is *only* provided when the -g3 level of  debug-info production is selected.  (The default level is -g2 and the  plain old -g option is considered to be identical to -g2.)   GCC records information about macro definitions and undefinitions primarily  in a section called the .debug_macinfo section.  Normal entries in the  .debug_macinfo section consist of the following three parts:  	 (1)	A special "type" byte.  	 (2)	A 3-byte line-number/filename-offset field.  	 (3)	A NUL terminated string.   The interpretation of the second and third parts is dependent upon the  value of the leading (type) byte.   The type byte may have one of four values depending upon the type of the  .debug_macinfo entry which follows.  The 1-byte MACINFO type codes presently  used, and their meanings are as follows:  	 MACINFO_start		A base file or an include file starts here. 	 MACINFO_resume		The current base or include file ends here. 	 MACINFO_define          A #define directive occurs here. 	 MACINFO_undef           A #undef directive occur here.   (Note that the MACINFO_... codes mentioned here are simply symbolic names  for constants which are defined in the GNU dwarf.h file.)   For MACINFO_define and MACINFO_undef entries, the second (3-byte) field  contains the number of the source line (relative to the start of the current  base source file or the current include files) when the #define or #undef  directive appears.  For a MACINFO_define entry, the following string field  contains the name of the macro which is defined, followed by its definition.  Note that the definition is always separated from the name of the macro  by at least one whitespace character.  For a MACINFO_undef entry, the  string which follows the 3-byte line number field contains just the name  of the macro which is being undef'ed.   For a MACINFO_start entry, the 3-byte field following the type byte contains  the offset, relative to the start of the .debug_sfnames section for the  current compilation unit, of a string which names the new source file which  is beginning its inclusion at this point.  Following that 3-byte field,  each MACINFO_start entry always contains a zero length NUL terminated  string.   For a MACINFO_resume entry, the 3-byte field following the type byte contains  the line number WITHIN THE INCLUDING FILE at which the inclusion of the  current file (whose inclusion ends here) was initiated.  Following that  3-byte field, each MACINFO_resume entry always contains a zero length NUL  terminated string.   Each set of .debug_macinfo entries for each compilation unit is terminated  by a special .debug_macinfo entry consisting of a 4-byte zero value followed  by a single NUL byte.   --------------------------------   In the current DWARF draft specification, no provision is made for providing  a separate level of (limited) debugging information necessary to support  tracebacks (only) through fully-debugged code (e.g. code in system libraries).   A proposal to define such a level was submitted (by me) to the UI/PLSIG.  This proposal was rejected by the UI/PLSIG for inclusion into the DWARF  version 1 specification for two reasons.  First, it was felt (by the PLSIG)  that the issues involved in supporting a "traceback only" subset of DWARF  were not well understood.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, the PLSIG  is already having enough trouble agreeing on what it means to be "conforming"  to the DWARF specification, and it was felt that trying to specify multiple  different *levels* of conformance would only complicate our discussions of  this already divisive issue.  Nonetheless, the GNU implementation of DWARF  provides an abbreviated "traceback only" level of debug-info production for  use with fully-debugged "system library" code.  This level should only be  used for fully debugged system library code, and even then, it should only  be used where there is a very strong need to conserve disk space.  This  abbreviated level of debug-info production can be used by specifying the  -g1 option on the compilation command line.   --------------------------------   As mentioned above, the GNU implementation of DWARF currently uses the DWARF  version 2 (draft) approach for inline functions (and inlined instances  thereof).  This is used in preference to the version 1 approach because  (quite simply) the version 1 approach is highly brain-damaged and probably  unworkable.   --------------------------------    GNU DWARF Representation of GNU C Extensions to ANSI C  ------------------------------------------------------   The file dwarfout.c has been designed and implemented so as to provide  some reasonable DWARF representation for each and every declarative  construct which is accepted by the GNU C compiler.  Since the GNU C  compiler accepts a superset of ANSI C, this means that there are some  cases in which the DWARF information produced by GCC must take some  liberties in improvising DWARF representations for declarations which  are only valid in (extended) GNU C.   In particular, GNU C provides at least three significant extensions to  ANSI C when it comes to declarations.  These are (1) inline functions,  and (2) dynamic arrays, and (3) incomplete enum types.  (See the GCC  manual for more information on these GNU extensions to ANSI C.)  When  used, these GNU C extensions are represented (in the generated DWARF  output of GCC) in the most natural and intuitively obvious ways.   In the case of inline functions, the DWARF representation is exactly as  called for in the DWARF version 2 (draft) specification for an identical  function written in C++; i.e. we "reuse" the representation of inline  functions which has been defined for C++ to support this GNU C extension.   In the case of dynamic arrays, we use the most obvious representational  mechanism available; i.e. an array type in which the upper bound of  some dimension (usually the first and only dimension) is a variable  rather than a constant.  (See the DWARF version 1 specification for more  details.)   In the case of incomplete enum types, such types are represented simply  as TAG_enumeration_type DIEs which DO NOT contain either AT_byte_size  attributes or AT_element_list attributes.   --------------------------------    Future Directions  -----------------   The codes, formats, and other paraphernalia necessary to provide proper  support for symbolic debugging for the C++ language are still being worked  on by the UI/PLSIG.  The vast majority of the additions to DWARF which will  be needed to completely support C++ have already been hashed out and agreed  upon, but a few small issues (e.g. anonymous unions, access declarations)  are still being discussed.  Also, we in the PLSIG are still discussing  whether or not we need to do anything special for C++ templates.  (At this  time it is not yet clear whether we even need to do anything special for  these.)    With regard to FORTRAN, the UI/PLSIG has defined what is believed to be a  complete and sufficient set of codes and rules for adequately representing  all of FORTRAN 77, and most of Fortran 90 in DWARF.  While some support for  this has been implemented in dwarfout.c, further implementation and testing  is needed.   GNU DWARF support for other languages (i.e. Pascal and Modula) is a moot  issue until there are GNU front-ends for these other languages.   As currently defined, DWARF only describes a (binary) language which can  be used to communicate symbolic debugging information from a compiler  through an assembler and a linker, to a debugger.  There is no clear  specification of what processing should be (or must be) done by the  assembler and/or the linker.  Fortunately, the role of the assembler  is easily inferred (by anyone knowledgeable about assemblers) just by  looking  at examples of assembly-level DWARF code.  Sadly though, the  allowable (or required) processing steps performed by a linker are  harder to infer and (perhaps) even harder to agree upon.  There are  several forms of very useful `post-processing' steps which intelligent  linkers *could* (in theory) perform on object files containing DWARF,  but any and all such link-time transformations are currently both disallowed  and unspecified.   In particular, possible link-time transformations of DWARF code which could  provide significant benefits include (but are not limited to):  	 Commonization of duplicate DIEs obtained from multiple input 	 (object) files.  	 Cross-compilation type checking based upon DWARF type information 	 for objects and functions.  	 Other possible `compacting' transformations designed to save disk 	 space and to reduce linker& debugger I/O activity.  */

Note that unlike the gcc front end (which generates a NULL named    TYPE_DECL node for each complete tagged type, each array type, and    each function type node created) the g++ front end generates a    _named_ TYPE_DECL node for each tagged type node created.    These TYPE_DECLs have DECL_ARTIFICIAL set, so we know not to    generate a DW_TAG_typedef DIE for them.  */

If necessary, these may be overridden from within your tm.h file,    but typically, you should never need to override these.     These labels have been hacked (temporarily) so that they all begin with    a `.L' sequence so as to appease the stock sparc/svr4 assembler and the    stock m88k/svr4 assembler, both of which need to see .L at the start of    a label in order to prevent that label from going into the linker symbol    table).  When I get time, I'll have to fix this the right way so that we    will use ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL and ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL herein,    but that will require a rather massive set of changes.  For the moment,    the following definitions out to produce the right results for all svr4    and svr3 assemblers. -- rfg */

comment|/* Given a pointer to a tree node for some type, return a Dwarf fundamental    type code for the given type.     This routine must only be called for GCC type nodes that correspond to    Dwarf fundamental types.     The current Dwarf draft specification calls for Dwarf fundamental types    to accurately reflect the fact that a given type was either a "plain"    integral type or an explicitly "signed" integral type.  Unfortunately,    we can't always do this, because GCC may already have thrown away the    information about the precise way in which the type was originally    specified, as in:  	typedef signed int my_type;  	struct s { my_type f; };     Since we may be stuck here without enough information to do exactly    what is called for in the Dwarf draft specification, we do the best    that we can under the circumstances and always use the "plain" integral    fundamental type codes for int, short, and long types.  That's probably    good enough.  The additional accuracy called for in the current DWARF    draft specification is probably never even useful in practice.  */

Calling this function while generating some "type related" form of DIE    makes it easy to later refer to the DIE which represents the given type    simply by re-generating the alternative name from the ..._TYPE node's    UID number.	*/

It converts the    RTL for a variable or parameter (resident in memory) into an equivalent    Dwarf representation of a mechanism for getting the address of that same    variable onto the top of a hypothetical "address evaluation" stack.     When creating memory location descriptors, we are effectively trans-    forming the RTL for a memory-resident object into its Dwarf postfix    expression equivalent.  This routine just recursively descends an    RTL tree, turning it into Dwarf postfix code as it goes.  */

They only describe (at best) how to get at these values at 	   the points in the generated code right after they have just 	   been computed.  Worse yet, in the typical case, the upper 	   bound values will not even *be* computed in the optimized 	   code, so these SAVE_EXPRs are entirely bogus.  	   In order to compensate for this fact, we check here to see 	   if optimization is enabled, and if so, we effectively create 	   an empty location description for the (unknown and unknowable) 	   upper bound.  	   This should not cause too much trouble for existing (stupid?) 	   debuggers because they have to deal with empty upper bounds 	   location descriptions anyway in order to be able to deal with 	   incomplete array types.  	   Of course an intelligent debugger (GDB?) should be able to 	   comprehend that a missing upper bound specification in a 	   array type used for a storage class `auto' local array variable 	   indicates that the upper bound is both unknown (at compile- 	   time) and unknowable (at run-time) due to optimization.  */

comment|/* Note that the GCC front-end doesn't make any attempt to keep track      of the starting bit offset (relative to the start of the containing      structure type) of the hypothetical "containing object" for a bit-      field.  Thus, when computing the byte offset value for the start of      the "containing object" of a bit-field, we must deduce this infor-      mation on our own.       This can be rather tricky to do in some cases.  For example, handling      the following structure type definition when compiling for an i386/i486      target (which only aligns long long's to 32-bit boundaries) can be very      tricky:  		struct S { 			int		field1; 			long long	field2:31; 		};       Fortunately, there is a simple rule-of-thumb which can be used in such      cases.  When compiling for an i386/i486, GCC will allocate 8 bytes for      the structure shown above.  It decides to do this based upon one simple      rule for bit-field allocation.  Quite simply, GCC allocates each "con-      taining object" for each bit-field at the first (i.e. lowest addressed)      legitimate alignment boundary (based upon the required minimum alignment      for the declared type of the field) which it can possibly use, subject      to the condition that there is still enough available space remaining      in the containing object (when allocated at the selected point) to      fully accommodate all of the bits of the bit-field itself.       This simple rule makes it obvious why GCC allocates 8 bytes for each      object of the structure type shown above.  When looking for a place to      allocate the "containing object" for `field2', the compiler simply tries      to allocate a 64-bit "containing object" at each successive 32-bit      boundary (starting at zero) until it finds a place to allocate that 64-      bit field such that at least 31 contiguous (and previously unallocated)      bits remain within that selected 64 bit field.  (As it turns out, for      the example above, the compiler finds that it is OK to allocate the      "containing object" 64-bit field at bit-offset zero within the      structure type.)       Here we attempt to work backwards from the limited set of facts we're      given, and we try to deduce from those facts, where GCC must have      believed that the containing object started (within the structure type).       The value we deduce is then used (by the callers of this routine) to      generate AT_location and AT_bit_offset attributes for fields (both      bit-fields and, in the case of AT_location, regular fields as well).  */

If this happens, then we get an object      which starts after the bitfield, which means that the bit offset is      negative.  Gdb fails when given negative bit offsets.  We avoid this      by recomputing using the first bit of the bitfield.  This will give      us an object which does not completely contain the bitfield, but it      will be aligned, and it will contain the first bit of the bitfield.       However, only do this for a BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN target.  For a      ! BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN target, bitpos_int + field_size_in_bits is the first      first bit of the bitfield.  If we recompute using bitpos_int + 1 below,      then we end up computing the object byte offset for the wrong word of the      desired bitfield, which in turn causes the field offset to be negative      in bit_offset_attribute.  */

Instead we output a zero-length location descriptor      value as part of the location attribute.       A variable which has been optimized out of existence will have a      DECL_RTL value which denotes a pseudo-reg.       Currently, in some rare cases, variables can have DECL_RTL values      which look like (MEM (REG pseudo-reg#)).  These cases are due to      bugs elsewhere in the compiler.  We treat such cases      as if the variable(s) in question had been optimized out of existence.       Note that in all cases where we wish to express the fact that a      variable has been optimized out of existence, we do not simply      suppress the generation of the entire location attribute because      the absence of a location attribute in certain kinds of DIEs is      used to indicate something else entirely... i.e. that the DIE      represents an object declaration, but not a definition.

comment|/* Here we have to decide where we are going to say the parameter "lives"      (as far as the debugger is concerned).  We only have a couple of choices.      GCC provides us with DECL_RTL and with DECL_INCOMING_RTL.  DECL_RTL      normally indicates where the parameter lives during most of the activa-      tion of the function.  If optimization is enabled however, this could      be either NULL or else a pseudo-reg.  Both of those cases indicate that      the parameter doesn't really live anywhere (as far as the code generation      parts of GCC are concerned) during most of the function's activation.      That will happen (for example) if the parameter is never referenced      within the function.       We could just generate a location descriptor here for all non-NULL      non-pseudo values of DECL_RTL and ignore all of the rest, but we can      be a little nicer than that if we also consider DECL_INCOMING_RTL in      cases where DECL_RTL is NULL or is a pseudo-reg.       Note however that we can only get away with using DECL_INCOMING_RTL as      a backup substitute for DECL_RTL in certain limited cases.  In cases      where DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) indicates the same type as TREE_TYPE(decl)      we can be sure that the parameter was passed using the same type as it      is declared to have within the function, and that its DECL_INCOMING_RTL      points us to a place where a value of that type is passed.  In cases      where DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) and TREE_TYPE(decl) are different types      however, we cannot (in general) use DECL_INCOMING_RTL as a backup      substitute for DECL_RTL because in these cases, DECL_INCOMING_RTL      points us to a value of some type which is *different* from the type      of the parameter itself.  Thus, if we tried to use DECL_INCOMING_RTL      to generate a location attribute in such cases, the debugger would      end up (for example) trying to fetch a `float' from a place which      actually contains the first part of a `double'.  That would lead to      really incorrect and confusing output at debug-time, and we don't      want that now do we?       So in general, we DO NOT use DECL_INCOMING_RTL as a backup for DECL_RTL      in cases where DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) != TREE_TYPE(decl).  There are a      couple of cute exceptions however.  On little-endian machines we can      get away with using DECL_INCOMING_RTL even when DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) is      not the same as TREE_TYPE(decl) but only when DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) is      an integral type which is smaller than TREE_TYPE(decl).  These cases      arise when (on a little-endian machine) a non-prototyped function has      a parameter declared to be of type `short' or `char'.  In such cases,      TREE_TYPE(decl) will be `short' or `char', DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) will be      `int', and DECL_INCOMING_RTL will point to the lowest-order byte of the      passed `int' value.  If the debugger then uses that address to fetch a      `short' or a `char' (on a little-endian machine) the result will be the      correct data, so we allow for such exceptional cases below.       Note that our goal here is to describe the place where the given formal      parameter lives during most of the function's activation (i.e. between      the end of the prologue and the start of the epilogue).  We'll do that      as best as we can.  Note however that if the given formal parameter is      modified sometime during the execution of the function, then a stack      backtrace (at debug-time) will show the function as having been called      with the *new* value rather than the value which was originally passed      in.  This happens rarely enough that it is not a major problem, but it      *is* a problem, and I'd like to fix it.  A future version of dwarfout.c      may generate two additional attributes for any given TAG_formal_parameter      DIE which will describe the "passed type" and the "passed location" for      the given formal parameter in addition to the attributes we now generate      to indicate the "declared type" and the "active location" for each      parameter.  This additional set of attributes could be used by debuggers      for stack backtraces.       Separately, note that sometimes DECL_RTL can be NULL and DECL_INCOMING_RTL      can be NULL also.  This happens (for example) for inlined-instances of      inline function formal parameters which are never referenced.  This really      shouldn't be happening.  All PARM_DECL nodes should get valid non-NULL      DECL_INCOMING_RTL values, but integrate.c doesn't currently generate      these values for inlined instances of inline function parameters, so      when we see such cases, we are just out-of-luck for the time      being (until integrate.c gets fixed).   */

See the comments within the function for a description of when it is    considered legitimate to output DIEs for various kinds of types.     Note that TYPE_CONTEXT(type) may be NULL (to indicate global scope)    or it may point to a BLOCK node (for types local to a block), or to a    FUNCTION_DECL node (for types local to the heading of some function    definition), or to a FUNCTION_TYPE node (for types local to the    prototyped parameter list of a function type specification), or to a    RECORD_TYPE, UNION_TYPE, or QUAL_UNION_TYPE node    (in the case of C++ nested types).     The `scope' parameter should likewise be NULL or should point to a    BLOCK node, a FUNCTION_DECL node, a FUNCTION_TYPE node, a RECORD_TYPE    node, a UNION_TYPE node, or a QUAL_UNION_TYPE node.     This function is used only for deciding when to "pend" and when to    "un-pend" types to/from the pending_types_list.     Note that we sometimes make use of this "type pending" feature in a    rather twisted way to temporarily delay the production of DIEs for the    types of formal parameters.  (We do this just to make svr4 SDB happy.)    It order to delay the production of DIEs representing types of formal    parameters, callers of this function supply `fake_containing_scope' as    the `scope' parameter to this function.  Given that fake_containing_scope    is a tagged type which is *not* the containing scope for *any* other type,    the desired effect is achieved, i.e. output of DIEs representing types    is temporarily suspended, and any type DIEs which would have otherwise    been output are instead placed onto the pending_types_list.  Later on,    we force these (temporarily pended) types to be output simply by calling    `output_pending_types_for_scope' with an actual argument equal to the    true scope of the types we temporarily pended.  */

Non-tagged-types on the other hand can      generally be output anywhere, except that svr4 SDB really doesn't      want to see them nested within struct or union types, so here we      say it is always OK to immediately output any such a (non-tagged)      type, so long as we are not within such a context.

That's true because of the 	   way the front-end does its processing of file-scope declarations (of 	   functions and class types) within which other types might be 	   nested.  The C and C++ front-ends always gobble up such "local 	   scope" things en-mass before they try to output *any* debugging 	   information for any of the stuff contained inside them and thus, 	   we get the benefit here of what is (in effect) a pre-resolution 	   of forward references to tagged types in local scopes.  	   Note however that for file-scope tagged types we cannot assume 	   that such pre-resolution of forward references has taken place. 	   A given file-scope tagged type may appear to be incomplete when 	   we reach this point, but it may yet be given a full definition 	   (at file-scope) later on during compilation.  In order to avoid 	   generating a premature (and possibly incorrect) set of Dwarf 	   DIEs for such (as yet incomplete) file-scope tagged types, we 	   generate nothing at all for as-yet incomplete file-scope tagged 	   types here unless we are making our special "finalization" pass 	   for file-scope things at the very end of compilation.  At that 	   time, we will certainly know as much about each file-scope tagged 	   type as we are ever going to know, so at that point in time, we 	   can safely generate correct Dwarf descriptions for these file- 	   scope tagged types.  */

Instead of passing the 	     current FUNCTION_DECL node as the second parameter (i.e. 	     the `containing_scope' parameter) to `output_decl' (as 	     we ought to) we instead pass a pointer to our own private 	     fake_containing_scope node.  That node is a RECORD_TYPE 	     node which NO OTHER TYPE may ever actually be a member of.  	     This pointer will ultimately get passed into `output_type' 	     as its `containing_scope' parameter.  `Output_type' will 	     then perform its part in the hack... i.e. it will pend 	     the type of the formal parameter onto the pending_types 	     list.  Later on, when we are done generating the whole 	     sequence of formal parameter DIEs for this function 	     definition, we will un-pend all previously pended types 	     of formal parameters for this function definition.  	     This whole kludge prevents any type DIEs from being 	     mixed in with the formal parameter DIEs.  That's good 	     because svr4 SDB believes that the list of formal 	     parameter DIEs for a function ends wherever the first 	     non-formal-parameter DIE appears.  Thus, we have to 	     keep the formal parameter DIEs segregated.  They must 	     all appear (consecutively) at the start of the list of 	     children for the DIE representing the function definition. 	     Then (and only then) may we output any additional DIEs 	     needed to represent the types of these formal parameters. 	  */

So here we just ignore all file-scope function declarations 	 which are not also definitions.  If and when the debugger needs 	 to know something about these functions, it will have to hunt 	 around and find the DWARF information associated with the 	 *definition* of the function.  	 Note that we can't just check `DECL_EXTERNAL' to find out which 	 FUNCTION_DECL nodes represent definitions and which ones represent 	 mere declarations.  We have to check `DECL_INITIAL' instead.  That's 	 because the C front-end supports some weird semantics for "extern 	 inline" function definitions.  These can get inlined within the 	 current translation unit (an thus, we need to generate DWARF info 	 for their abstract instances so that the DWARF info for the 	 concrete inlined instances can have something to refer to) but 	 the compiler never generates any out-of-lines instances of such 	 things (despite the fact that they *are* definitions).  The 	 important point is that the C front-end marks these "extern inline" 	 functions as DECL_EXTERNAL, but we need to generate DWARF for them 	 anyway.  	 Note that the C++ front-end also plays some similar games for inline 	 function definitions appearing within include files which also 	 contain `#pragma interface' pragmas.  */

We need such numbers for the sake of generating labels (in the    .debug_sfnames section) and references to those unique labels (in the    .debug_srcinfo and .debug_macinfo sections).     If the filename given as an argument is not found in our current list,    add it to the list and assign it the next available unique index number.     Whatever we do (i.e. whether we find a pre-existing filename or add a new    one), we shuffle the filename found (or added) up to the zeroth entry of    our list of filenames (which is always searched linearly).  We do this so    as to optimize the most common case for these filename lookups within    dwarfout.c.  The most common case by far is the case where we call    lookup_filename to lookup the very same filename that we did a lookup    on the last time we called lookup_filename.  We make sure that this    common case is fast because such cases will constitute 99.9% of the    lookups we ever do (in practice).     If we add a new filename entry to our table, we go ahead and generate    the corresponding entry in the .debug_sfnames section right away.    Doing so allows us to avoid tickling an assembler bug (present in some    m68k assemblers) which yields assembly-time errors in cases where the    difference of two label addresses is taken and where the two labels    are in a section *other* than the one where the difference is being    calculated, and where at least one of the two symbol references is a    forward reference.  (This bug could be tickled by our .debug_srcinfo    entries if we don't output their corresponding .debug_sfnames entries    before them.) */

comment|/* Mark the end of the chain of siblings which represent all file-scope      declarations in this compilation unit.  */
comment|/* The (null) DIE which represents the terminator for the (sibling linked)      list of file-scope items is *special*.  Normally, we would just call      end_sibling_chain at this point in order to output a word with the      value `4' and that word would act as the terminator for the list of      DIEs describing file-scope items.  Unfortunately, if we were to simply      do that, the label that would follow this DIE in the .debug section      (i.e. `..D2') would *not* be properly aligned (as it must be on some      machines) to a 4 byte boundary.       In order to force the label `..D2' to get aligned to a 4 byte boundary,      the trick used is to insert extra (otherwise useless) padding bytes      into the (null) DIE that we know must precede the ..D2 label in the      .debug section.  The amount of padding required can be anywhere between      0 and 3 bytes.  The length word at the start of this DIE (i.e. the one      with the padding) would normally contain the value 4, but now it will      also have to include the padding bytes, so it will instead have some      value in the range 4..7.       Fortunately, the rules of Dwarf say that any DIE whose length word      contains *any* value less than 8 should be treated as a null DIE, so      this trick works out nicely.  Clever, eh?  Don't give me any credit      (or blame).  I didn't think of this scheme.  I just conformed to it.   */
