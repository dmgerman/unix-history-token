comment|/* This structure is used to remap objects in the function being inlined to    those belonging to the calling function.  It is passed by    expand_inline_function to its children.     This structure is also used when unrolling loops and otherwise    replicating code, although not all fields are needed in this case;    only those fields needed by copy_rtx_and_substitute() and its children    are used.     This structure is used instead of static variables because    expand_inline_function may be called recursively via expand_expr.  */

We      cannot in general substitute constants into parameter pseudo registers,      since some machine descriptions (many RISCs) won't always handle      the resulting insns.  So if an incoming parameter has a constant      equivalent, we record it here, and if the resulting insn is      recognizable, we go with it.       We also use this mechanism to convert references to incoming arguments      and stacked variables.  copy_rtx_and_substitute will replace the virtual      incoming argument and virtual stacked variables registers with new      pseudos that contain pointers into the replacement area allocated for      this inline instance.  These pseudos are then marked as being equivalent      to the appropriate address and substituted if valid.  */
