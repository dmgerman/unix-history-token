comment|/* This is the loop optimization pass of the compiler.    It finds invariant computations within loops and moves them    to the beginning of the loop.  Then it identifies basic and     general induction variables.  Strength reduction is applied to the general    induction variables, and induction variable elimination is applied to    the basic induction variables.     It also finds cases where    a register is set within the loop by zero-extending a narrower value    and changes these to zero the entire register once before the loop    and merely copy the low part within the loop.     Most of the complexity is in heuristics to decide when it is worth    while to do these things.  */

Also look for blocks of code ending in an unconditional branch that      exits the loop.  If such a block is surrounded by a conditional       branch around the block, move the block elsewhere (see below) and      invert the jump to point to the code block.

DEST_REG is the biv's reg.     MULT_VAL is const1_rtx if the biv is being incremented here, in which case    INC_VAL is the increment.  Otherwise, MULT_VAL is const0_rtx and the biv is    being set to INC_VAL.     NOT_EVERY_ITERATION is nonzero if this biv update is not know to be    executed every iteration; MAYBE_MULTIPLE is nonzero if this biv update    can be executed more than once per iteration.  If MAYBE_MULTIPLE    and NOT_EVERY_ITERATION are both zero, we know that the biv update is    executed exactly once per iteration.  */

First we have the situation      of a giv that is only updated conditionally.  In that case, it may not      derive any givs after a label is passed.       The second case is when a biv update occurs, or may occur, after the      definition of a giv.  For certain biv updates (see below) that are      known to occur between the giv definition and use, we can adjust the      giv definition.  For others, or when the biv update is conditional,      we must prevent the giv from deriving any other givs.  There are two      sub-cases within this case.       If this is a label, we are concerned with any biv update that is done      conditionally, since it may be done after the giv is defined followed by      a branch here (actually, we need to pass both a jump and a label, but      this extra tracking doesn't seem worth it).       If this is a jump, we are concerned about any biv update that may be      executed multiple times.  We are actually only concerned about      backward jumps, but it is probably not worth performing the test      on the jump again here.       If this is a biv update, we must adjust the giv status to show that a      subsequent biv update was performed.  If this adjustment cannot be done,      the giv cannot derive further givs.  */

comment|/* Check whether an insn is an increment legitimate for a basic induction var.    X is the source of insn P, or a part of it.    MODE is the mode in which X should be interpreted.     DEST_REG is the putative biv, also the destination of the insn.    We accept patterns of these forms:      REG = REG + INVARIANT (includes REG = REG - CONSTANT)      REG = INVARIANT + REG     If X is suitable, we return 1, set *MULT_VAL to CONST1_RTX,    store the additive term into *INC_VAL, and store the place where    we found the additive term into *LOCATION.     If X is an assignment of an invariant into DEST_REG, we set    *MULT_VAL to CONST0_RTX, and store the invariant into *INC_VAL.     We also want to detect a BIV when it corresponds to a variable    whose mode was promoted via PROMOTED_MODE.  In that case, an increment    of the variable may be a PLUS that adds a SUBREG of that variable to    an invariant and then sign- or zero-extends the result of the PLUS    into the variable.     Most GIVs in such cases will be in the promoted mode, since that is the    probably the natural computation mode (and almost certainly the mode    used for addresses) on the machine.  So we view the pseudo-reg containing    the variable as the BIV, as if it were simply incremented.     Note that treating the entire pseudo as a BIV will result in making    simple increments to any GIVs based on it.  However, if the variable    overflows in its declared mode but not its promoted mode, the result will    be incorrect.  This is acceptable if the variable is signed, since     overflows in such cases are undefined, but not if it is unsigned, since    those overflows are defined.  So we only check for SIGN_EXTEND and    not ZERO_EXTEND.     If we cannot find a biv, we return 0.  */

The invariant expressions must each be of a form that can be used as a    machine operand.  We surround then with a USE rtx (a hack, but localized    and certainly unambiguous!) if not a CONST_INT for simplicity in this    routine; it is the caller's responsibility to strip them.     If no such canonicalization is possible (i.e., two biv's are used or an    expression that is neither invariant nor a biv or giv), this routine    returns 0.     For a non-zero return, the result will have a code of CONST_INT, USE,    REG (for a BIV), PLUS, or MULT.  No other codes will occur.       *BENEFIT will be incremented by the benefit of any sub-giv encountered.  */

The value is 0 if the reg set in P is not really a giv.    Otherwise, the value is the amount gained by eliminating    all the consecutive insns that compute the value.     FIRST_BENEFIT is the amount gained by eliminating the first insn, P.    SRC_REG is the reg of the biv; DEST_REG is the reg of the giv.     The coefficients of the ultimate giv value are stored in    *MULT_VAL and *ADD_VAL.  */

To perform the computation, we note that    	G1 = x * v + a		and 	G2 = y * v + b    where `v' is the biv.     So G2 = (y/b) * G1 + (b - a*y/x).     Note that MULT = y/x.

If ELIMINATE_P is non-zero, actually do the elimination.  WHERE indicates    where extra insns should be added.  Depending on how many items have been    moved out of the loop, it will either be before INSN or at the start of    the loop.  */

comment|/* This code has problems.  Basically, you can't know when 	     seeing if we will eliminate BL, whether a particular giv 	     of ARG will be reduced.  If it isn't going to be reduced, 	     we can't eliminate BL.  We can try forcing it to be reduced, 	     but that can generate poor code.  	     The problem is that the benefit of reducing TV, below should 	     be increased if BL can actually be eliminated, but this means 	     we might have to do a topological sort of the order in which 	     we try to process biv.  It doesn't seem worthwhile to do 	     this sort of thing now.  */

If the condition cannot be understood, or is an    inequality floating-point comparison which needs to be reversed, 0 will    be returned.     If EARLIEST is non-zero, it is a pointer to a place where the earliest    insn used in locating the condition was found.  If a replacement test    of the condition is desired, it should be placed in front of that    insn and we will be sure that the inputs are still valid.     The condition will be returned in a canonical form to simplify testing by    callers.  Specifically:     (1) The code will always be a comparison operation (EQ, NE, GT, etc.).    (2) Both operands will be machine operands; (cc0) will have been replaced.    (3) If an operand is a constant, it will be the second operand.    (4) (LE x const) will be replaced with (LT x<const+1>) and similarly        for GE, GEU, and LEU.  */
