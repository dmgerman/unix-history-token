comment|/* Instruction scheduling pass.     This pass implements list scheduling within basic blocks.  It is    run twice: (1) after flow analysis, but before register allocation,    and (2) after register allocation.     The first run performs interblock scheduling, moving insns between    different blocks in the same "region", and the second runs only    basic block scheduling.     Interblock motions performed are useful motions and speculative    motions, including speculative loads.  Motions requiring code    duplication are not supported.  The identification of motion type    and the check for validity of speculative motions requires    construction and analysis of the function's control flow graph.    The scheduler works as follows:     We compute insn priorities based on data dependencies.  Flow    analysis only creates a fraction of the data-dependencies we must    observe: namely, only those dependencies which the combiner can be    expected to use.  For this pass, we must therefore create the    remaining dependencies we need to observe: register dependencies,    memory dependencies, dependencies to keep function calls in order,    and the dependence between a conditional branch and the setting of    condition codes are all dealt with here.     The scheduler first traverses the data flow graph, starting with    the last instruction, and proceeding to the first, assigning values    to insn_priority as it goes.  This sorts the instructions    topologically by data dependence.     Once priorities have been established, we order the insns using    list scheduling.  This works as follows: starting with a list of    all the ready insns, and sorted according to priority number, we    schedule the insn from the end of the list by placing its    predecessors in the list according to their priority order.  We    consider this insn scheduled by setting the pointer to the "end" of    the list to point to the previous insn.  When an insn has no    predecessors, we either queue it until sufficient time has elapsed    or add it to the ready list.  As the instructions are scheduled or    when stalls are introduced, the queue advances and dumps insns into    the ready list.  When all insns down to the lowest priority have    been scheduled, the critical path of the basic block has been made    as short as possible.  The remaining insns are then scheduled in    remaining slots.     Function unit conflicts are resolved during forward list scheduling    by tracking the time when each insn is committed to the schedule    and from that, the time the function units it uses must be free.    As insns on the ready list are considered for scheduling, those    that would result in a blockage of the already committed insns are    queued until no blockage will result.     The following list shows the order in which we want to break ties    among insns in the ready list:     1.  choose insn with the longest path to end of bb, ties    broken by    2.  choose insn with least contribution to register pressure,    ties broken by    3.  prefer in-block upon interblock motion, ties broken by    4.  prefer useful upon speculative motion, ties broken by    5.  choose insn with largest control flow probability, ties    broken by    6.  choose insn with the least dependences upon the previously    scheduled insn, or finally    7   choose the insn which has the most insns dependent on it.    8.  choose insn with lowest UID.     Memory references complicate matters.  Only if we can be certain    that memory references are not part of the data dependency graph    (via true, anti, or output dependence), can we move operations past    memory references.  To first approximation, reads can be done    independently, while writes introduce dependencies.  Better    approximations will yield fewer dependencies.     Before reload, an extended analysis of interblock data dependences    is required for interblock scheduling.  This is performed in    compute_block_backward_dependences ().     Dependencies set up by memory references are treated in exactly the    same way as other dependencies, by using LOG_LINKS backward    dependences.  LOG_LINKS are translated into INSN_DEPEND forward    dependences for the purpose of forward list scheduling.     Having optimized the critical path, we may have also unduly    extended the lifetimes of some registers.  If an operation requires    that constants be loaded into registers, it is certainly desirable    to load those constants as early as necessary, but no earlier.    I.e., it will not do to load up a bunch of registers at the    beginning of a basic block only to use them at the end, if they    could be loaded later, since this may result in excessive register    utilization.     Note that since branches are never in basic blocks, but only end    basic blocks, this pass will not move branches.  But that is ok,    since we can use GNU's delayed branch scheduling pass to take care    of this case.     Also note that no further optimizations based on algebraic    identities are performed, so this pass would be a good one to    perform instruction splitting, such as breaking up a multiply    instruction into shifts and adds where that is profitable.     Given the memory aliasing analysis that this pass should perform,    it should be possible to remove redundant stores to memory, and to    load values from registers instead of hitting memory.     Before reload, speculative insns are moved only if a 'proof' exists    that no exception will be caused by this, and if no live registers    exist that inhibit the motion (live registers constraints are not    represented by data dependence edges).     This pass must update information that subsequent passes expect to    be correct.  Namely: reg_n_refs, reg_n_sets, reg_n_deaths,    reg_n_calls_crossed, and reg_live_length.  Also, BLOCK_HEAD,    BLOCK_END.     The information in the line number notes is carefully retained by    this pass.  Notes that refer to the starting and ending of    exception regions are also carefully retained by this pass.  All    other NOTE insns are grouped in their same relative order at the    beginning of basic blocks and regions that have been scheduled.     The main entry point for this pass is schedule_insns(), called for    each function.  The work of the scheduler is organized in three    levels: (1) function level: insns are subject to splitting,    control-flow-graph is constructed, regions are computed (after    reload, each region is of one block), (2) region level: control    flow graph attributes required for interblock scheduling are    computed (dominators, reachability, etc.), data dependences and    priorities are computed, and (3) block level: insns in the block    are actually scheduled.  */

It is important to ensure that all    insns which use its result will not be executed until its result    has been computed.  An insn is maintained in one of four structures:     (P) the "Pending" set of insns which cannot be scheduled until    their dependencies have been satisfied.    (Q) the "Queued" set of insns that can be scheduled when sufficient    time has passed.    (R) the "Ready" list of unscheduled, uncommitted insns.    (S) the "Scheduled" list of insns.     Initially, all insns are either "Pending" or "Ready" depending on    whether their dependencies are satisfied.     Insns move from the "Ready" list to the "Scheduled" list as they    are committed to the schedule.  As this occurs, the insns in the    "Pending" list have their dependencies satisfied and move to either    the "Ready" list or the "Queued" set depending on whether    sufficient time has passed to make them ready.  As time passes,    insns move from the "Queued" set to the "Ready" list.  Insns may    move from the "Ready" list to the "Queued" set if they are blocked    due to a function unit conflict.     The "Pending" list (P) are the insns in the INSN_DEPEND of the unscheduled    insns, i.e., those that are ready, queued, and pending.    The "Queued" set (Q) is implemented by the variable `insn_queue'.    The "Ready" list (R) is implemented by the variables `ready' and    `n_ready'.    The "Scheduled" list (S) is the new insn chain built by this pass.     The transition (R->S) is implemented in the scheduling loop in    `schedule_block' when the best insn to schedule is chosen.    The transition (R->Q) is implemented in `queue_insn' when an    insn is found to have a function unit conflict with the already    committed insns.    The transitions (P->R and P->Q) are implemented in `schedule_insn' as    insns move from the ready list to the scheduled list.    The transition (Q->R) is implemented in 'queue_to_insn' as time    passes or stalls are introduced.  */

comment|/* Notes handling mechanism:    =========================    Generally, NOTES are saved before scheduling and restored after scheduling.    The scheduler distinguishes between three types of notes:     (1) LINE_NUMBER notes, generated and used for debugging.  Here,    before scheduling a region, a pointer to the LINE_NUMBER note is    added to the insn following it (in save_line_notes()), and the note    is removed (in rm_line_notes() and unlink_line_notes()).  After    scheduling the region, this pointer is used for regeneration of    the LINE_NUMBER note (in restore_line_notes()).     (2) LOOP_BEGIN, LOOP_END, SETJMP, EHREGION_BEG, EHREGION_END notes:    Before scheduling a region, a pointer to the note is added to the insn    that follows or precedes it.  (This happens as part of the data dependence    computation).  After scheduling an insn, the pointer contained in it is    used for regenerating the corresponding note (in reemit_notes).     (3) All other notes (e.g. INSN_DELETED):  Before scheduling a block,    these notes are put in a list (in rm_other_notes() and    unlink_other_notes ()).  After scheduling the block, these notes are    inserted at the beginning of the block (in schedule_block()).  */

A region for scheduling can be:       * A loop-free procedure, or       * A reducible inner loop, or       * A basic block not contained in any other region.      ?!? In theory we could build other regions based on extended basic    blocks or reverse extended basic blocks.  Is it worth the trouble?     Loop blocks that form a region are put into the region's block list    in topological order.     This procedure stores its results into the following global (ick) variables       * rgn_nr      * rgn_table      * rgn_bb_table      * block_to_bb      * containing region      We use dominator relationships to avoid making regions out of non-reducible    loops.     This procedure needs to be converted to work on pred/succ lists instead    of edge tables.  That would simplify it somewhat.  */

We know the loop is a natural loop; however the algorithm 	     above will not always mark certain blocks as being in the 	     loop.  Consider: 		node   children 		 a	  b,c 		 b	  c 		 c	  a,d 		 d	  b   	     The algorithm in the DFS traversal may not mark B& D as part 	     of the loop (ie they will not have max_hdr set to A).  	     We know they can not be loop latches (else they would have 	     had max_hdr set since they'd have a backedge to a dominator 	     block).  So we don't need them on the initial queue.  	     We know they are part of the loop because they are dominated 	     by the loop header and can be reached by a backwards walk of 	     the edges starting with nodes on the initial queue.  	     It is safe and desirable to include those nodes in the 	     loop/scheduling region.  To do so we would need to decrease 	     the degree of a node if it is the target of a backedge 	     within the loop itself as the node is placed in the queue.  	     We do not do this because I'm not sure that the actual 	     scheduling code will properly handle this case. ?!? */

comment|/* Exception Free Loads:     We define five classes of speculative loads: IFREE, IRISKY,    PFREE, PRISKY, and MFREE.     IFREE loads are loads that are proved to be exception-free, just    by examining the load insn.  Examples for such loads are loads    from TOC and loads of global data.     IRISKY loads are loads that are proved to be exception-risky,    just by examining the load insn.  Examples for such loads are    volatile loads and loads from shared memory.     PFREE loads are loads for which we can prove, by examining other    insns, that they are exception-free.  Currently, this class consists    of loads for which we are able to find a "similar load", either in    the target block, or, if only one split-block exists, in that split    block.  Load2 is similar to load1 if both have same single base    register.  We identify only part of the similar loads, by finding    an insn upon which both load1 and load2 have a DEF-USE dependence.     PRISKY loads are loads for which we can prove, by examining other    insns, that they are exception-risky.  Currently we have two proofs for    such loads.  The first proof detects loads that are probably guarded by a    test on the memory address.  This proof is based on the    backward and forward data dependence information for the region.    Let load-insn be the examined load.    Load-insn is PRISKY iff ALL the following hold:     - insn1 is not in the same block as load-insn    - there is a DEF-USE dependence chain (insn1, ..., load-insn)    - test-insn is either a compare or a branch, not in the same block as load-insn    - load-insn is reachable from test-insn    - there is a DEF-USE dependence chain (insn1, ..., test-insn)     This proof might fail when the compare and the load are fed    by an insn not in the region.  To solve this, we will add to this    group all loads that have no input DEF-USE dependence.     The second proof detects loads that are directly or indirectly    fed by a speculative load.  This proof is affected by the    scheduling process.  We will use the flag  fed_by_spec_load.    Initially, all insns have this flag reset.  After a speculative    motion of an insn, if insn is either a load, or marked as    fed_by_spec_load, we will also mark as fed_by_spec_load every    insn1 for which a DEF-USE dependence (insn, insn1) exists.  A    load which is fed_by_spec_load is also PRISKY.     MFREE (maybe-free) loads are all the remaining loads. They may be    exception-free, but we cannot prove it.     Now, all loads in IFREE and PFREE classes are considered    exception-free, while all loads in IRISKY and PRISKY classes are    considered exception-risky.  As for loads in the MFREE class,    these are considered either exception-free or exception-risky,    depending on whether we are pessimistic or optimistic.  We have    to take the pessimistic approach to assure the safety of    speculative scheduling, but we can take the optimistic approach    by invoking the -fsched_spec_load_dangerous option.  */

Two passes follow: The first pass is performed before the scheduling    of a region. It scans each block of the region forward, computing    the set of registers alive at the end of the basic block and    discard REG_DEAD notes (done by find_pre_sched_live ()).     The second path is invoked after scheduling all region blocks.    It scans each block of the region backward, a block being traversed    only after its succesors in the region. When the set of registers    live at the end of a basic block may be changed by the scheduling    (this may happen for multiple blocks region), it is computed as    the union of the registers live at the start of its succesors.    The last-use information is updated by inserting REG_DEAD notes.    (done by find_post_sched_live ()) */

This is only a problem when we zero calls 	   crossed for a pseudo live in multiple basic blocks.  	   Alternatively, we could try to correctly update basic block live 	   at start here in sched, but that seems complicated.

In a multiple blocks region:    (1) a bb is analyzed after its predecessors, and (2) the lists in    effect at the end of bb (after analyzing for bb) are inherited by    bb's successrs.     Specifically for reg-reg data dependences, the block insns are    scanned by sched_analyze () top-to-bottom.  Two lists are    naintained by sched_analyze (): reg_last_defs[] for register DEFs,    and reg_last_uses[] for register USEs.     When analysis is completed for bb, we update for its successors:    ;  - DEFS[succ] = Union (DEFS [succ], DEFS [bb])    ;  - USES[succ] = Union (USES [succ], DEFS [bb])     The mechanism for computing mem-mem data dependence is very    similar, and the result is interblock dependences in the region.  */

We use xmalloc instead of alloca, because max_uid can be very large      when there is a lot of function inlining.  If we used alloca, we could      exceed stack limits on some hosts for some inputs.  */
