comment|/* Classes overload their constituent function names automatically.    When a function name is declared in a record structure,    its name is changed to it overloaded name.  Since names for    constructors and destructors can conflict, we place a leading    '$' for destructors.     CNAME is the name of the class we are grokking for.     FUNCTION is a FUNCTION_DECL.  It was created by `grokdeclarator'.     FLAGS contains bits saying what's special about today's    arguments.  1 == DESTRUCTOR.  2 == OPERATOR.     If FUNCTION is a destructor, then we must add the `auto-delete' field    as a second parameter.  There is some hair associated with the fact    that we must "declare" this variable in the manner consistent with the    way the rest of the arguments were declared.     QUALS are the qualifiers for the this pointer.  */

It is rather important that such things be ignored because 	     any effort to actually generate DWARF for them will run 	     into trouble when/if we encounter code like:  		#pragma interface 		struct S { virtual void member (); };  	      because the artificial declaration of the vtable itself (as 	      manufactured by the g++ front end) will say that the vtable 	      is a static member of `S' but only *after* the debug output 	      for the definition of `S' has already been output.  This causes 	      grief because the DWARF entry for the definition of the vtable 	      will try to refer back to an earlier *declaration* of the 	      vtable as a static member of `S' and there won't be one. 	      We might be able to arrange to have the "vtable static member" 	      attached to the member list for `S' before the debug info for 	      `S' get written (which would solve the problem) but that would 	      require more intrusive changes to the g++ front end.  */

If the last thing pushed onto the global_binding_level was a      virtual function table, then slicing it out would slice away all the      decls (i.e., we lose the head of the chain).       There are several ways of getting the same effect, from changing the      way that iterators over the chain treat the elements that pertain to      virtual function tables, moving the implementation of this code to      decl.c (where we can manipulate global_binding_level directly),      popping the garbage after pushing it and slicing away the vtable      stuff, or just leaving it alone. */
