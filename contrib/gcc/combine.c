comment|/* This module is essentially the "combiner" phase of the U. of Arizona    Portable Optimizer, but redone to work on our list-structured    representation for RTL instead of their string representation.     The LOG_LINKS of each insn identify the most recent assignment    to each REG used in the insn.  It is a list of previous insns,    each of which contains a SET for a REG that is used in this insn    and not used or set in between.  LOG_LINKs never cross basic blocks.    They were set up by the preceding pass (lifetime analysis).     We try to combine each pair of insns joined by a logical link.    We also try to combine triples of insns A, B and C when    C has a link back to B and B has a link back to A.     LOG_LINKS does not have links for use of the CC0.  They don't    need to, because the insn that sets the CC0 is always immediately    before the insn that tests it.  So we always regard a branch    insn as having a logical link to the preceding insn.  The same is true    for an insn explicitly using CC0.     We check (with use_crosses_set_p) to avoid combining in such a way    as to move a computation to a place where its value would be different.     Combination is done by mathematically substituting the previous    insn(s) values for the regs they set into the expressions in    the later insns that refer to these regs.  If the result is a valid insn    for our target machine, according to the machine description,    we install it, delete the earlier insns, and update the data flow    information (LOG_LINKS and REG_NOTES) for what we did.     There are a few exceptions where the dataflow information created by    flow.c aren't completely updated:     - reg_live_length is not updated    - reg_n_refs is not adjusted in the rare case when a register is      no longer required in a computation    - there are extremely rare cases (see distribute_regnotes) when a      REG_DEAD note is lost    - a LOG_LINKS entry that refers to an insn with multiple SETs may be      removed because there is no way to know which register it was      linking     To simplify substitution, we combine only when the earlier insn(s)    consist of only a single assignment.  To simplify updating afterward,    we never combine when a subroutine call appears in the middle.     Since we do not represent assignments to CC0 explicitly except when that    is all an insn does, there is no LOG_LINKS entry in an insn that uses    the condition code for the insn that set the condition code.    Fortunately, these two insns must be consecutive.    Therefore, every JUMP_INSN is taken to have an implicit logical link    to the preceding insn.  This is not quite right, since non-jumps can    also use the condition code; but in practice such insns would not    combine anyway.  */

comment|/* The next group of arrays allows the recording of the last value assigned    to (hard or pseudo) register n.  We use this information to see if a    operation being processed is redundant given a prior operation performed    on the register.  For example, an `and' with a constant is redundant if    all the zero bits are already known to be turned off.     We use an approach similar to that used by cse, but change it in the    following ways:     (1) We do not want to reinitialize at each label.    (2) It is useful, but not critical, to know the actual value assigned        to a register.  Often just its form is helpful.     Therefore, we maintain the following arrays:     reg_last_set_value		the last value assigned    reg_last_set_label		records the value of label_tick when the 				register was assigned    reg_last_set_table_tick	records the value of label_tick when a 				value using the register is assigned    reg_last_set_invalid		set to non-zero when it is not valid 				to use the value of this register in some 				register's value     To understand the usage of these tables, it is important to understand    the distinction between the value in reg_last_set_value being valid    and the register being validly contained in some other expression in the    table.     Entry I in reg_last_set_value is valid if it is non-zero, and either    reg_n_sets[i] is 1 or reg_last_set_label[i] == label_tick.     Register I may validly appear in any expression returned for the value    of another register if reg_n_sets[i] is 1.  It may also appear in the    value for register J if reg_last_set_label[i]< reg_last_set_label[j] or    reg_last_set_invalid[j] is zero.     If an expression is found in the table containing a register which may    not validly appear in an expression, the register is replaced by    something that won't match, (clobber (const_int 0)).     reg_last_set_invalid[i] is set non-zero when register I is being assigned    to and reg_last_set_table_tick[i] == label_tick.  */

We do, however, allow I2 to follow a CC0-setting insn if that insn      is passed as I1; in that case it will be deleted also.      We also allow combining in this case if all the insns are adjacent      because that would leave the two CC0 insns adjacent as well.      It would be more logical to test whether CC0 occurs inside I1 or I2,      but that would be much slower, and this ought to be equivalent.  */

comment|/* LOC is the location within I3 that contains its pattern or the component    of a PARALLEL of the pattern.  We validate that it is valid for combining.     One problem is if I3 modifies its output, as opposed to replacing it    entirely, we can't allow the output to contain I2DEST or I1DEST as doing    so would produce an insn that is not equivalent to the original insns.     Consider:           (set (reg:DI 101) (reg:DI 100)) 	 (set (subreg:SI (reg:DI 101) 0)<foo>)     This is NOT equivalent to:           (parallel [(set (subreg:SI (reg:DI 100) 0)<foo>) 		    (set (reg:DI 101) (reg:DI 100))])     Not only does this modify 100 (in which case it might still be valid    if 100 were dead in I2), it sets 101 to the ORIGINAL value of 100.     We can also run into a problem if I2 sets a register that I1    uses and I1 gets directly substituted into I3 (not via I2).  In that    case, we would be getting the wrong value of I2DEST into I3, so we    must reject the combination.  This case occurs when I2 and I1 both    feed into I3, rather than when I1 feeds into I2, which feeds into I3.    If I1_NOT_IN_SRC is non-zero, it means that finding I1 in the source    of a SET must prevent combination from occurring.     Before doing the above check, we first try to expand a field assignment    into a set of logical operations.     If PI3_DEST_KILLED is non-zero, it is a pointer to a location in which    we place a register that is both set and used within I3.  If more than one    such register is detected, we fail.     Return 1 if the combination is valid, zero otherwise.  */

Namely, the case where I1 is zero, I2 is a PARALLEL      and I3 is a SET whose SET_SRC is a SET_DEST in I2.  In that case,      we may be able to replace that destination with the destination of I3.      This occurs in the common code where we compute both a quotient and      remainder into a structure, in which case we want to do the computation      directly into the structure to avoid register-register copies.       Note that this case handles both multiple sets in I2 and also      cases where I2 has a number of CLOBBER or PARALLELs.       We make very conservative checks below and only try to handle the      most common cases of this.  For example, we only handle the case      where I2 and I3 are adjacent to avoid making difficult register      usage tests.  */

Another way to do this would be to have a function that tries to      simplify a single insn instead of merging two or more insns.

The second element of the vector will set some pseudo to the result      of the same arithmetic operation.  If we simplify the COMPARE, we won't      match such a pattern and so will generate an extra insn.

If they were modified, a record was made in undobuf so that    undo_all will (among other things) return X to its original state.     If the number of changes necessary is too much to record to undo,    the excess changes are not made, so the result is invalid.    The changes already made can still be undone.    undobuf.num_undo is incremented for such changes, so by testing that    the caller can tell whether the result is valid.     `n_occurrences' is incremented each time FROM is replaced.     IN_DEST is non-zero if we are processing the SET_DEST of a SET.     UNIQUE_COPY is non-zero if each substitution must be unique.  We do this    by copying if `n_occurrences' is non-zero.  */

comment|/* If this is a PLUS, MINUS, or MULT, and the first operand is the      sign extension of a PLUS with a constant, reverse the order of the sign      extension and the addition. Note that this not the same as the original      code, but overflow is undefined for signed values.  Also note that the      PLUS will have been partially moved "inside" the sign-extension, so that      the first operand of X will really look like:          (ashiftrt (plus (ashift A C4) C5) C4).      We convert this to          (plus (ashiftrt (ashift A C4) C2) C4)      and replace the first operand of X with that expression.  Later parts      of this function may simplify the expression further.       For example, if we start with (mult (sign_extend (plus A C1)) C2),      we swap the SIGN_EXTEND and PLUS.  Later code will apply the      distributive law to produce (plus (mult (sign_extend X) C1) C3).       We do this to simplify address expressions.  */

Similarly, we can convert EQ to 	     (xor X 1) or (minus 1 X); we use the former.  Finally, if X is 	     known to be either 0 or -1, NE becomes a NEG and EQ becomes 	     (plus X 1).  	     Remove any ZERO_EXTRACT we made when thinking this was a 	     comparison.  It may now be simpler to use, e.g., an AND.  If a 	     ZERO_EXTRACT is indeed appropriate, it will be placed back by 	     the call to make_compound_operation in the SET case.  */

ZERO_EXTEND is also considered "compound" because it can be replaced with    an AND operation, which is simpler, though only one operation.     The function expand_compound_operation is called with an rtx expression    and will convert it to the appropriate shifts and AND operations,    simplifying at each stage.     The function make_compound_operation is called to convert an expression    consisting of shifts and ANDs into the equivalent compound expression.    It is the inverse of this function, loosely speaking.  */

comment|/* If we reach here, we want to return a pair of shifts.  The inner      shift is a left shift of BITSIZE - POS - LEN bits.  The outer      shift is a right shift of BITSIZE - LEN bits.  It is arithmetic or      logical depending on the value of UNSIGNEDP.       If this was a ZERO_EXTEND or ZERO_EXTRACT, this pair of shifts will be      converted into an AND of a shift.       We must check for the case where the left shift would have a negative      count.  This can happen in a case like (x>> 31)& 255 on machines      that can't shift by a constant.  On those machines, we would first      combine the shift with the AND to produce a variable-position      extraction.  Then the constant of 31 would be substituted in to produce      a such a position.  */

comment|/* Return an RTX for a reference to LEN bits of INNER.  If POS_RTX is nonzero,    it is an RTX that represents a variable starting position; otherwise,    POS is the (constant) starting bit position (counted from the LSB).     INNER may be a USE.  This will occur when we started with a bitfield    that went outside the boundary of the object in memory, which is    allowed on most machines.  To isolate this case, we produce a USE    whose mode is wide enough and surround the MEM with it.  The only    code that understands the USE is this routine.  If it is not removed,    it will cause the resulting insn not to match.     UNSIGNEDP is non-zero for an unsigned reference and zero for a    signed reference.     IN_DEST is non-zero if this is a reference in the destination of a    SET.  This is used when a ZERO_ or SIGN_EXTRACT isn't needed.  If non-zero,    a STRICT_LOW_PART will be used, if zero, ZERO_EXTEND or SIGN_EXTEND will    be used.     IN_COMPARE is non-zero if we are in a COMPARE.  This means that a    ZERO_EXTRACT should be built even for bits starting at bit 0.     MODE is the desired mode of the result (if IN_DEST == 0).     The result is an RTX for the extraction or NULL_RTX if the target    can't handle it.  */

Return the new rtx, usually just X.     Also, for machines like the VAX that don't have logical shift insns,    try to convert logical to arithmetic shift operations in cases where    they are equivalent.  This undoes the canonicalizations to logical    shifts done elsewhere.     We try, as much as possible, to re-use rtl expressions to save memory.     IN_CODE says what kind of expression we are processing.  Normally, it is    SET.  In a memory address (inside a MEM, PLUS or minus, the latter two    being kludges), it is MEM.  When processing the arguments of a comparison    or a COMPARE against zero, it is COMPARE.  */

Return a possibly simplified expression, but always convert X to    MODE.  If X is a CONST_INT, AND the CONST_INT with MASK.     Also, if REG is non-zero and X is a register equal in value to REG,    replace X with REG.     If JUST_SELECT is nonzero, don't optimize by noticing that bits in MASK    are all off in X.

In both case, this function returns the number of "spare"    bits.  For example, if two quantities for which this function returns    at least 1 are added, the addition is known not to overflow.

comment|/* This function is called from `simplify_shift_const' to merge two    outer operations.  Specifically, we have already found that we need    to perform operation *POP0 with constant *PCONST0 at the outermost    position.  We would now like to also perform OP1 with constant CONST1    (with *POP0 being done last).     Return 1 if we can do the operation and update *POP0 and *PCONST0 with    the resulting operation.  *PCOMP_P is set to 1 if we would need to    complement the innermost operand, otherwise it is unchanged.     MODE is the mode in which the operation will be done.  No bits outside    the width of this mode matter.  It is assumed that the width of this mode    is smaller than or equal to HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT.     If *POP0 or OP1 are NIL, it means no operation is required.  Only NEG, PLUS,    IOR, XOR, and AND are supported.  We may set *POP0 to SET if the proper    result is simply *PCONST0.     If the resulting operation cannot be expressed as one operation, we    return 0 and do not change *POP0, *PCONST0, and *PCOMP_P.  */
