comment|/*  * Compressed packet format:  *  * The first octet contains the packet type (top 3 bits), TCP  * 'push' bit, and flags that indicate which of the 4 TCP sequence  * numbers have changed (bottom 5 bits).  The next octet is a  * conversation number that associates a saved IP/TCP header with  * the compressed packet.  The next two octets are the TCP checksum  * from the original datagram.  The next 0 to 15 octets are  * sequence number changes, one change per bit set in the header  * (there may be no changes and there are two special cases where  * the receiver implicitly knows what changed -- see below).  *  * There are 5 numbers which can change (they are always inserted  * in the following order): TCP urgent pointer, window,  * acknowlegement, sequence number and IP ID.  (The urgent pointer  * is different from the others in that its value is sent, not the  * change in value.)  Since typical use of SLIP links is biased  * toward small packets (see comments on MTU/MSS below), changes  * use a variable length coding with one octet for numbers in the  * range 1 - 255 and 3 octets (0, MSB, LSB) for numbers in the  * range 256 - 65535 or 0.  (If the change in sequence number or  * ack is more than 65535, an uncompressed packet is sent.)  */

comment|/*  * Packet types (must not conflict with IP protocol version)  *  * The top nibble of the first octet is the packet type.  There are  * three possible types: IP (not proto TCP or tcp with one of the  * control flags set); uncompressed TCP (a normal IP/TCP packet but  * with the 8-bit protocol field replaced by an 8-bit connection id --  * this type of packet syncs the sender& receiver); and compressed  * TCP (described above).  *  * LSB of 4-bit field is TCP "PUSH" bit (a worthless anachronism) and  * is logically part of the 4-bit "changes" field that follows.  Top  * three bits are actual packet type.  For backward compatibility  * and in the interest of conserving bits, numbers are chosen so the  * IP protocol version number (4) which normally appears in this nibble  * means "IP packet".  */
