comment|/**  * DEPRECATED openpam_readlinev  *  * The =openpam_readline function reads a line from a file, and returns it  * in a NUL-terminated buffer allocated with =!malloc.  *  * The =openpam_readline function performs a certain amount of processing  * on the data it reads:  *  *  - Comments (introduced by a hash sign) are stripped.  *  *  - Blank lines are ignored.  *  *  - If a line ends in a backslash, the backslash is stripped and the  *    next line is appended.  *  * If =lineno is not =NULL, the integer variable it points to is  * incremented every time a newline character is read.  *  * If =lenp is not =NULL, the length of the line (not including the  * terminating NUL character) is stored in the variable it points to.  *  * The caller is responsible for releasing the returned buffer by passing  * it to =!free.  *  *>openpam_readlinev  *>openpam_readword  */
