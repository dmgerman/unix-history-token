comment|/**  * The =openpam_straddch function appends a character to a dynamically  * allocated NUL-terminated buffer, reallocating the buffer as needed.  *  * The =str argument points to a variable containing either a pointer to  * an existing buffer or =NULL.  * If the value of the variable pointed to by =str is =NULL, a new buffer  * is allocated.  *  * The =size and =len argument point to variables used to hold the size  * of the buffer and the length of the string it contains, respectively.  *  * The final argument, =ch, is the character that should be appended to  * the string.  If =ch is 0, nothing is appended, but a new buffer is  * still allocated if =str is NULL.  This can be used to "bootstrap" the  * string.  *  * If a new buffer is allocated or an existing buffer is reallocated to  * make room for the additional character, =str and =size are updated  * accordingly.  *  * The =openpam_straddch function ensures that the buffer is always  * NUL-terminated.  *  * If the =openpam_straddch function is successful, it increments the  * integer variable pointed to by =len (unless =ch was 0) and returns 0.  * Otherwise, it leaves the variables pointed to by =str, =size and =len  * unmodified, sets :errno to =ENOMEM and returns -1.  *  * AUTHOR DES  */
