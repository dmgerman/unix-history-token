On a SPARC, the table is composed of 12 byte entries, each of      which consists of three instructions.  The first entry is          sethi %hi(0),%g1 	 jmp %g1 	 nop      These instructions are changed by ld.so into a jump directly into      ld.so itself.  Each subsequent entry is          save %sp, -96, %sp 	 call<address of first entry in procedure linkage table><reloc_number | 0x01000000>      The reloc_number is the number of the reloc to use to resolve      this entry.  The reloc will be a JMP_SLOT reloc against some      symbol that is not defined in this object file but should be      defined in a shared object (if it is not, ld.so will report a      runtime error and exit).  The constant 0x010000000 turns the      reloc number into a sethi of %g0, which does nothing since %g0 is      hardwired to zero.       When one of these entries is executed, it winds up calling into      ld.so.  ld.so looks at the reloc number, available via the return      address, to determine which entry this is.  It then looks at the      reloc and patches up the entry in the table into a sethi and jmp      to the real address followed by a nop.  This means that the reloc      lookup only has to happen once, and it also means that the      relocation only needs to be done if the function is actually      called.  The relocation is expensive because ld.so must look up      the symbol by name.       The size of the procedure linkage table is given by the ld_plt_sz      field.  */

comment|/* The address of a hash table of symbols.  The hash table has      roughly the same number of entries as there are dynamic symbols;      I think the only way to get the exact size is to assume that      every byte from ld_hash to ld_stab is devoted to the hash table.       Each entry in the hash table is eight bytes.  The first four      bytes are a symbol index into the dynamic symbols.  The second      four bytes are the index of the next hash table entry in the      bucket.  The ld_buckets field gives the number of buckets, say B.      The first B entries in the hash table each start a bucket which      is chained through the second four bytes of each entry.  A value      of zero ends the chain.       The hash function is simply          h = 0;          while (*string != '\0') 	   h = (h<< 1) + *string++; 	 h&= 0x7fffffff;       To look up a symbol, compute the hash value of the name.  Take      the modulos of hash value and the number of buckets.  Start at      that entry in the hash table.  See if the symbol (from the first      four bytes of the hash table entry) has the name you are looking      for.  If not, use the chain field (the second four bytes of the      hash table entry) to move on to the next entry in this bucket.      If the chain field is zero you have reached the end of the      bucket, and the symbol is not in the hash table.  */
