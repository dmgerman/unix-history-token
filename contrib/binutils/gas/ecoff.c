comment|/* This file constructs the information used by the ECOFF debugging    format.  It just builds a large block of data.     We support both ECOFF style debugging and stabs debugging (the    stabs symbols are encapsulated in ECOFF symbols).  This should let    us handle anything the compiler might throw at us.  */

comment|/* Here is a brief description of the MIPS ECOFF symbol table, by    Michael Meissner.  The MIPS symbol table has the following pieces:  	Symbolic Header 	    | 	    +--	Auxiliary Symbols 	    | 	    +--	Dense number table 	    | 	    +--	Optimizer Symbols 	    | 	    +--	External Strings 	    | 	    +--	External Symbols 	    | 	    +--	Relative file descriptors 	    | 	    +--	File table 		    | 		    +--	Procedure table 		    | 		    +--	Line number table 		    | 		    +--	Local Strings 		    | 		    +--	Local Symbols     The symbolic header points to each of the other tables, and also    contains the number of entries.  It also contains a magic number    and MIPS compiler version number, such as 2.0.     The auxiliary table is a series of 32 bit integers, that are    referenced as needed from the local symbol table.  Unlike standard    COFF, the aux.  information does not follow the symbol that uses    it, but rather is a separate table.  In theory, this would allow    the MIPS compilers to collapse duplicate aux. entries, but I've not    noticed this happening with the 1.31 compiler suite.  The different    types of aux. entries are:      1)	dnLow: Low bound on array dimension.      2)	dnHigh: High bound on array dimension.      3)	isym: Index to the local symbol which is the start of the 	function for the end of function first aux. entry.      4)	width: Width of structures and bitfields.      5)	count: Count of ranges for variant part.      6)	rndx: A relative index into the symbol table.  The relative 	index field has two parts: rfd which is a pointer into the 	relative file index table or ST_RFDESCAPE which says the next 	aux. entry is the file number, and index: which is the pointer 	into the local symbol within a given file table.  This is for 	things like references to types defined in another file.      7)	Type information: This is like the COFF type bits, except it 	is 32 bits instead of 16; they still have room to add new 	basic types; and they can handle more than 6 levels of array, 	pointer, function, etc.  Each type information field contains 	the following structure members:  	    a)	fBitfield: a bit that says this is a bitfield, and the 		size in bits follows as the next aux. entry.  	    b)	continued: a bit that says the next aux. entry is a 		continuation of the current type information (in case 		there are more than 6 levels of array/ptr/function).  	    c)	bt: an integer containing the base type before adding 		array, pointer, function, etc. qualifiers.  The 		current base types that I have documentation for are:  			btNil		-- undefined 			btAdr		-- address - integer same size as ptr 			btChar		-- character 			btUChar		-- unsigned character 			btShort		-- short 			btUShort	-- unsigned short 			btInt		-- int 			btUInt		-- unsigned int 			btLong		-- long 			btULong		-- unsigned long 			btFloat		-- float (real) 			btDouble	-- Double (real) 			btStruct	-- Structure (Record) 			btUnion		-- Union (variant) 			btEnum		-- Enumerated 			btTypedef	-- defined via a typedef isymRef 			btRange		-- subrange of int 			btSet		-- pascal sets 			btComplex	-- fortran complex 			btDComplex	-- fortran double complex 			btIndirect	-- forward or unnamed typedef 			btFixedDec	-- Fixed Decimal 			btFloatDec	-- Float Decimal 			btString	-- Varying Length Character String 			btBit		-- Aligned Bit String 			btPicture	-- Picture 			btVoid		-- Void (MIPS cc revision>= 2.00)  	    d)	tq0 - tq5: type qualifier fields as needed.  The 		current type qualifier fields I have documentation for 		are:  			tqNil		-- no more qualifiers 			tqPtr		-- pointer 			tqProc		-- procedure 			tqArray		-- array 			tqFar		-- 8086 far pointers 			tqVol		-- volatile     The dense number table is used in the front ends, and disappears by    the time the .o is created.     With the 1.31 compiler suite, the optimization symbols don't seem    to be used as far as I can tell.     The linker is the first entity that creates the relative file    descriptor table, and I believe it is used so that the individual    file table pointers don't have to be rewritten when the objects are    merged together into the program file.     Unlike COFF, the basic symbol& string tables are split into    external and local symbols/strings.  The relocation information    only goes off of the external symbol table, and the debug    information only goes off of the internal symbol table.  The    external symbols can have links to an appropriate file index and    symbol within the file to give it the appropriate type information.    Because of this, the external symbols are actually larger than the    internal symbols (to contain the link information), and contain the    local symbol structure as a member, though this member is not the    first member of the external symbol structure (!).  I suspect this    split is to make strip easier to deal with.     Each file table has offsets for where the line numbers, local    strings, local symbols, and procedure table starts from within the    global tables, and the indexs are reset to 0 for each of those    tables for the file.     The procedure table contains the binary equivalents of the .ent    (start of the function address), .frame (what register is the    virtual frame pointer, constant offset from the register to obtain    the VFP, and what register holds the return address), .mask/.fmask    (bitmask of saved registers, and where the first register is stored    relative to the VFP) assembler directives.  It also contains the    low and high bounds of the line numbers if debugging is turned on.     The line number table is a compressed form of the normal COFF line    table.  Each line number entry is either 1 or 3 bytes long, and    contains a signed delta from the previous line, and an unsigned    count of the number of instructions this statement takes.     The local symbol table contains the following fields:      1)	iss: index to the local string table giving the name of the 	symbol.      2)	value: value of the symbol (address, register number, etc.).      3)	st: symbol type.  The current symbol types are:  	    stNil	  -- Nuthin' special 	    stGlobal	  -- external symbol 	    stStatic	  -- static 	    stParam	  -- procedure argument 	    stLocal	  -- local variable 	    stLabel	  -- label 	    stProc	  -- External Procedure 	    stBlock	  -- beginning of block 	    stEnd	  -- end (of anything) 	    stMember	  -- member (of anything) 	    stTypedef	  -- type definition 	    stFile	  -- file name 	    stRegReloc	  -- register relocation 	    stForward	  -- forwarding address 	    stStaticProc  -- Static procedure 	    stConstant	  -- const      4)	sc: storage class.  The current storage classes are:  	    scText	  -- text symbol 	    scData	  -- initialized data symbol 	    scBss	  -- un-initialized data symbol 	    scRegister	  -- value of symbol is register number 	    scAbs	  -- value of symbol is absolute 	    scUndefined   -- who knows? 	    scCdbLocal	  -- variable's value is IN se->va.?? 	    scBits	  -- this is a bit field 	    scCdbSystem	  -- value is IN debugger's address space 	    scRegImage	  -- register value saved on stack 	    scInfo	  -- symbol contains debugger information 	    scUserStruct  -- addr in struct user for current process 	    scSData	  -- load time only small data 	    scSBss	  -- load time only small common 	    scRData	  -- load time only read only data 	    scVar	  -- Var parameter (fortranpascal) 	    scCommon	  -- common variable 	    scSCommon	  -- small common 	    scVarRegister -- Var parameter in a register 	    scVariant	  -- Variant record 	    scSUndefined  -- small undefined(external) data 	    scInit	  -- .init section symbol      5)	index: pointer to a local symbol or aux. entry.

The T_NULL type    really should use bt_Void, but this causes the current ecoff GDB to    issue unsupported type messages, and the Ultrix 4.00 dbx (aka MIPS    2.0) doesn't understand it, even though the compiler generates it.    Maybe this will be fixed in 2.10 or 2.20 of the MIPS compiler    suite, but for now go with what works.     It would make sense for the .type and .scl directives to use the    ECOFF numbers directly, rather than using the COFF numbers and    mapping them.  Unfortunately, this is historically what mips-tfile    expects, and changing gcc now would be a considerable pain (the    native compiler generates debugging information internally, rather    than via the assembler, so it will never use .type or .scl).  */

See for instance      ecoff_build_lineno, which will end up setting all file->fdr.*      fields multiple times, resulting in incorrect debug info.  In      order to make this work right, all line number and symbol info      for the same source file has to be adjacent in the object file,      so that a single file descriptor can be used to point to them.      This would require maintaining file specific lists of line      numbers and symbols for each file, so that they can be merged      together (or output together) when two .file pseudo-ops are      merged into one file descriptor.  */

comment|/* For some reason the address of the first procedure is ignored      when reading line numbers.  This doesn't matter if the address of      the first procedure is 0, but when gcc is generating MIPS      embedded PIC code, it will put strings in the .text section      before the first procedure.  We cope by inserting a dummy line if      the address of the first procedure is not 0.  Hopefully this      won't screw things up too badly.       Don't do this for ECOFF assembly source line numbers.  They work      without this extra attention.  */
