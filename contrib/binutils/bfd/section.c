comment|/* SECTION 	Sections  	The raw data contained within a BFD is maintained through the 	section abstraction.  A single BFD may have any number of 	sections.  It keeps hold of them by pointing to the first; 	each one points to the next in the list.  	Sections are supported in BFD in<<section.c>>.  @menu @* Section Input:: @* Section Output:: @* typedef asection:: @* section prototypes:: @end menu  INODE Section Input, Section Output, Sections, Sections SUBSECTION 	Section input  	When a BFD is opened for reading, the section structures are 	created and attached to the BFD.  	Each section has a name which describes the section in the 	outside world---for example,<<a.out>> would contain at least 	three sections, called<<.text>>,<<.data>> and<<.bss>>.  	Names need not be unique; for example a COFF file may have several 	sections named<<.data>>.  	Sometimes a BFD will contain more than the ``natural'' number of 	sections. A back end may attach other sections containing 	constructor data, or an application may add a section (using<<bfd_make_section>>) to the sections attached to an already open 	BFD. For example, the linker creates an extra section<<COMMON>> for each input file's BFD to hold information about 	common storage.  	The raw data is not necessarily read in when 	the section descriptor is created. Some targets may leave the 	data in place until a<<bfd_get_section_contents>> call is 	made. Other back ends may read in all the data at once.  For 	example, an S-record file has to be read once to determine the 	size of the data. An IEEE-695 file doesn't contain raw data in 	sections, but data and relocation expressions intermixed, so 	the data area has to be parsed to get out the data and 	relocations.  INODE Section Output, typedef asection, Section Input, Sections  SUBSECTION 	Section output  	To write a new object style BFD, the various sections to be 	written have to be created. They are attached to the BFD in 	the same way as input sections; data is written to the 	sections using<<bfd_set_section_contents>>.  	Any program that creates or combines sections (e.g., the assembler 	and linker) must use the<<asection>> fields<<output_section>> and<<output_offset>> to indicate the file sections to which each 	section must be written.  (If the section is being created from 	scratch,<<output_section>> should probably point to the section 	itself and<<output_offset>> should probably be zero.)  	The data to be written comes from input sections attached 	(via<<output_section>> pointers) to 	the output sections.  The output section structure can be 	considered a filter for the input section: the output section 	determines the vma of the output data and the name, but the 	input section determines the offset into the output section of 	the data to be written.  	E.g., to create a section "O", starting at 0x100, 0x123 long, 	containing two subsections, "A" at offset 0x0 (i.e., at vma 	0x100) and "B" at offset 0x20 (i.e., at vma 0x120) the<<asection>> 	structures would look like:  |   section name          "A" |     output_offset   0x00 |     size            0x20 |     output_section ----------->  section name    "O" |                             |    vma             0x100 |   section name          "B" |    size            0x123 |     output_offset   0x20    | |     size            0x103   | |     output_section  --------|  SUBSECTION 	Link orders  	The data within a section is stored in a @dfn{link_order}. 	These are much like the fixups in<<gas>>.  The link_order 	abstraction allows a section to grow and shrink within itself.  	A link_order knows how big it is, and which is the next 	link_order and where the raw data for it is; it also points to 	a list of relocations which apply to it.  	The link_order is used by the linker to perform relaxing on 	final code.  The compiler creates code which is as big as 	necessary to make it work without relaxing, and the user can 	select whether to relax.  Sometimes relaxing takes a lot of 	time.  The linker runs around the relocations to see if any 	are attached to data which can be shrunk, if so it does it on 	a link_order by link_order basis.  */
