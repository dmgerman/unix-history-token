comment|/* Return TRUE iff @a pattern matches @a hostname as defined  * by the matching rules of RFC 6125.  In the context of RFC  * 6125 the pattern is the domain name portion of the presented  * identifier (which comes from the Common Name or a DNSName  * portion of the subjectAltName of an X.509 certificate) and  * the hostname is the source domain (i.e. the host portion  * of the URI the user entered).  *  * @note With respect to wildcards we only support matching  * wildcards in the left-most label and as the only character  * in the left-most label (i.e. we support RFC 6125 รยง 6.4.3  * Rule 1 and 2 but not the optional Rule 3).  This may change  * in the future.  *  * @note Subversion does not at current support internationalized  * domain names.  Both values are presumed to be in NR-LDH label  * or A-label form (see RFC 5890 for the definition).  *  * @since New in 1.9.  */
