comment|/* INTERFACE CONVENTIONS     "OUT" PARAMETERS     There are numerous functions within this API which take a (large) number    of "out" parameters. These are listed individually, rather than combined    into a struct, so that a caller can be fine-grained about the which    pieces of information are being requested. In many cases, only a subset    is required, so the implementation can perform various optimizations    to fulfill the limited request for information.      POOLS     wc_db uses the dual-pool paradigm for all of its functions. Any OUT    parameter will be allocated within the result pool, and all temporary    allocations will be performed within the scratch pool.     The pool that DB is allocated within (the "state" pool) is only used    for a few, limited allocations to track each of the working copy roots    that the DB is asked to operate upon. The memory usage on this pool    is O(# wcroots), which should normally be one or a few. Custom clients    which hold open structures over a significant period of time should    pay particular attention to the number of roots touched, and the    resulting impact on memory consumption (which should still be minimal).      PARAMETER CONVENTIONS     * Parameter Order      - any output arguments      - DB      - LOCAL_ABSPATH      - any other input arguments      - RESULT_POOL      - SCRATCH_POOL     * DB      This parameter is the primary context for all operations on the      metadata for working copies. This parameter is passed to almost every      function, and maintains information and state about every working      copy "touched" by any of the APIs in this interface.     * *_ABSPATH      All *_ABSPATH parameters in this API are absolute paths in the local      filesystem, represented in Subversion internal canonical form.     * LOCAL_ABSPATH      This parameter specifies a particular *versioned* node in the local      filesystem. From this node, a working copy root is implied, and will      be used for the given API operation.     * LOCAL_DIR_ABSPATH      This parameter is similar to LOCAL_ABSPATH, but the semantics of the      parameter and operation require the node to be a directory within      the working copy.     * WRI_ABSPATH      This is a "Working copy Root Indicator" path. This refers to a location      in the local filesystem that is anywhere inside a working copy. The given      operation will be performed within the context of the root of that      working copy. This does not necessarily need to refer to a specific      versioned node or the root of a working copy (although it can) -- any      location, existing or not, is sufficient, as long as it is inside a      working copy.      ### TODO: Define behaviour for switches and externals.      ### Preference has been stated that WRI_ABSPATH should imply the root      ### of the parent WC of all switches and externals, but that may      ### not play out well, especially with multiple repositories involved. */

comment|/* Open a working copy administrative database context.     This context is (initially) not associated with any particular working    copy directory or working copy root (wcroot). As operations are performed,    this context will load the appropriate wcroot information.     The context is returned in DB.     CONFIG should hold the various configuration options that may apply to    the administrative operation. It should live at least as long as the    RESULT_POOL parameter.     When OPEN_WITHOUT_UPGRADE is TRUE, then the working copy databases will    be opened even when an old database format is found/detected during    the operation of a wc_db API). If open_without_upgrade is FALSE and an    upgrade is required, then SVN_ERR_WC_UPGRADE_REQUIRED will be returned    from that API.    Passing TRUE will allow a bare minimum of APIs to function (most notably,    the temp_get_format() function will always return a value) since most of    these APIs expect a current-format database to be present.     If ENFORCE_EMPTY_WQ is TRUE, then any databases with stale work items in    their work queue will raise an error when they are opened. The operation    will raise SVN_ERR_WC_CLEANUP_REQUIRED. Passing FALSE for this routine    means that the work queue is being processed (via 'svn cleanup') and all    operations should be allowed.     The DB will be closed when RESULT_POOL is cleared. It may also be closed    manually using svn_wc__db_close(). In particular, this will close any    SQLite databases that have been opened and cached.     The context is allocated in RESULT_POOL. This pool is *retained* and used    for future allocations within the DB. Be forewarned about unbounded    memory growth if this DB is used across an unbounded number of wcroots    and versioned directories.     Temporary allocations will be made in SCRATCH_POOL. */

comment|/* ### KFF: This is an interesting question, because currently    ### symlinks are versioned as regular files with the svn:special    ### property; then the file's text contents indicate that it is a    ### symlink and where that symlink points.  That's for portability:    ### you can check 'em out onto a platform that doesn't support    ### symlinks, and even modify the link and check it back in.  It's    ### a great solution; but then the question for wc-ng is:    ###    ### Suppose you check out a symlink on platform X and platform Y.    ### X supports symlinks; Y does not.  Should the wc-ng storage for    ### those two be the same?  I mean, on platform Y, the file is just    ### going to look and behave like a regular file.  It would be sort    ### of odd for the wc-ng storage for that file to be of a different    ### type from all the other files.  (On the other hand, maybe it's    ### weird today that the wc-1 storage for a working symlink is to    ### be like a regular file (i.e., regular text-base and whatnot).    ###    ### I'm still feeling my way around this problem; just pointing out    ### the issues.     ### gjs: symlinks are stored in the database as first-class objects,    ###   rather than in the filesystem as "special" regular files. thus,    ###   all portability concerns are moot. higher-levels can figure out    ###   how to represent the link in ACTUAL. higher-levels can also    ###   deal with translating to/from the svn:special property and    ###   the plain-text file contents.    ### dlr: What about hard links? At minimum, mention in doc string. */

comment|/* Remove a node and all its descendants from the BASE tree. This handles    the deletion of a tree from the update editor and some file external    scenarios.     The node to remove is indicated by LOCAL_ABSPATH from the local    filesystem.     This operation *installs* workqueue operations to update the local    filesystem after the database operation.     To maintain a consistent database this function will also remove    any working node that marks LOCAL_ABSPATH as base-deleted.  If this    results in there being no working node for LOCAL_ABSPATH then any    actual node will be removed if the actual node does not mark a    conflict.     If KEEP_AS_WORKING is TRUE, then the base tree is copied to higher    layers as a copy of itself before deleting the BASE nodes.     If KEEP_AS_WORKING is FALSE, and QUEUE_DELETES is TRUE, also queue    workqueue items to delete all in-wc representations that aren't    shadowed by higher layers.    (With KEEP_AS_WORKING TRUE, this is a no-op, as everything is     automatically shadowed by the created copy)     If REMOVE_LOCKS is TRUE, all locks of this node and any subnodes    are also removed. This is to be done during commit of deleted nodes.     If NOT_PRESENT_REVISION specifies a valid revision a not-present    node is installed in BASE node with kind NOT_PRESENT_KIND after    deleting.     If CONFLICT and/or WORK_ITEMS are passed they are installed as part    of the operation, after the work items inserted by the operation    itself. */

See HAVE_BASE to see        if this change overwrites a BASE node. Use scan_addition() to resolve        whether this has been added, copied, or moved, and the details of the        operation (this function only looks at LOCAL_ABSPATH, but resolving        the details requires scanning one or more ancestor nodes).       svn_wc__db_status_deleted        This node has been deleted or moved away. It may be a delete/move of        a BASE node, or a child node of a subtree that was copied/moved to        an ancestor location. Call scan_deletion() to determine the full        details of the operations upon this node.       svn_wc__db_status_server_excluded        The node is versioned/known by the server, but the server has        decided not to provide further information about the node. This        is a BASE node (since changes are not allowed to this node).       svn_wc__db_status_excluded        The node has been excluded from the working copy tree. This may        be an exclusion from the BASE tree, or an exclusion in the        WORKING tree for a child node of a copied/moved parent.       svn_wc__db_status_not_present        This is a node from the BASE tree, has been marked as "not-present"        within this mixed-revision working copy. This node is at a revision        that is not in the tree, contrary to its inclusion in the parent        node's revision.       svn_wc__db_status_incomplete        The BASE is incomplete due to an interrupted operation.  An        incomplete WORKING node will be svn_wc__db_status_added.     If REVISION is requested, it will be set to the revision of the    unmodified (BASE) node, or to SVN_INVALID_REVNUM if any structural    changes have been made to that node (that is, if the node has a row in    the WORKING table).     If DEPTH is requested, and the node is NOT a directory, then    the value will be set to svn_depth_unknown.     If CHECKSUM is requested, and the node is NOT a file, then it will    be set to NULL.     If TARGET is requested, and the node is NOT a symlink, then it will    be set to NULL.     If TRANSLATED_SIZE is requested, and the node is NOT a file, then    it will be set to SVN_INVALID_FILESIZE.     If HAVE_WORK is TRUE, the returned information is from the highest WORKING    layer. In that case HAVE_MORE_WORK and HAVE_BASE provide information about    what other layers exist for this node.     If HAVE_WORK is FALSE and HAVE_BASE is TRUE then the information is from    the BASE tree.     If HAVE_WORK and HAVE_BASE are both FALSE and when retrieving CONFLICTED,    then the node doesn't exist at all.     If OP_ROOT is requested and the node has a WORKING layer, OP_ROOT will be    set to true if this node is the op_root for this layer.     If HAD_PROPS is requested and the node has pristine props, the value will    be set to TRUE.     If PROPS_MOD is requested and the node has property modification the value    will be set to TRUE.     ### add information about the need to scan upwards to get a complete    ### picture of the state of this node.     ### add some documentation about OUT parameter values based on STATUS ??     ### the TEXT_MOD may become an enumerated value at some point to    ### indicate different states of knowledge about text modifications.    ### for example, an "svn edit" command in the future might set a    ### flag indicating administratively-defined modification. and/or we    ### might have a status indicating that we saw it was modified while    ### performing a filesystem traversal.

OP_ROOT_ABSPATH will be set to the topmost node in the added subtree        (implying its parent will be an unshadowed BASE node).

The root of the copy will be stored in OP_ROOT_ABSPATH. Note that        the parent of the operation root could be another WORKING node (from        an add, copy, or move).

The root of the moved nodes will be stored in OP_ROOT_ABSPATH.        Similar to the copied state, its parent may be a WORKING node or a        BASE node. And again, the REPOS_* values are implied by this node's        position in the subtree under the ancestor unshadowed BASE node.        ORIGINAL_* will indicate the source of the move.     All OUT parameters may be NULL to indicate a lack of interest in    that piece of information.     STATUS, OP_ROOT_ABSPATH, and REPOS_* will always be assigned a value    if that information is requested (and assuming a successful return).     ORIGINAL_REPOS_RELPATH will refer to the *root* of the operation. It    does *not* correspond to the node given by LOCAL_ABSPATH.

comment|/* Scan upwards for additional information about a deleted node.     When a deleted node is discovered in the WORKING tree, the situation    may be quite complex. This function will provide the information to    resolve the circumstances of the deletion.     For discussion purposes, we will start with the most complex example    and then demonstrate simplified examples. Consider node B/W/D/N has been    found as deleted. B is an unmodified directory (thus, only in BASE). W is    "replacement" content that exists in WORKING, shadowing a similar B/W    directory in BASE. D is a deleted subtree in the WORKING tree, and N is    the deleted node.     In this example, BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will bet set to B/W. That is the root of    the BASE tree (implicitly) deleted by the replacement. WORK_DEL_ABSPATH    will be set to the subtree deleted within the replacement; in this case,    B/W/D. No move-away took place, so MOVED_TO_ABSPATH is set to NULL.     In another scenario, B/W was moved-away before W was put into the WORKING    tree through an add/copy/move-here. MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will indicate where    B/W was moved to. Note that further operations may have been performed    post-move, but that is not known or reported by this function.     If BASE does not have a B/W, then the WORKING B/W is not a replacement,    but a simple add/copy/move-here. BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will be set to NULL.     If B/W/D does not exist in the WORKING tree (we're only talking about a    deletion of nodes of the BASE tree), then deleting B/W/D would have marked    the subtree for deletion. BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will refer to B/W/D,    MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will be NULL, and WORK_DEL_ABSPATH will be NULL.     If the BASE node B/W/D was moved instead of deleted, then MOVED_TO_ABSPATH    would indicate the target location (and other OUT values as above).     When the user deletes B/W/D from the WORKING tree, there are a few    additional considerations. If B/W is a simple addition (not a copy or    a move-here), then the deletion will simply remove the nodes from WORKING    and possibly leave behind "base-delete" markers in the WORKING tree.    If the source is a copy/moved-here, then the nodes are replaced with    deletion markers.     If the user moves-away B/W/D from the WORKING tree, then behavior is    again dependent upon the origination of B/W. For a plain add, the nodes    simply move to the destination; this means that B/W/D ceases to be a    node and so cannot be scanned. For a copy, a deletion is made at B/W/D,    and a new copy (of a subtree of the original source) is made at the    destination. For a move-here, a deletion is made, and a copy is made at    the destination (we do not track multiple moves; the source is moved to    B/W, then B/W/D is deleted; then a copy is made at the destination;    however, note the double-move could have been performed by moving the    subtree first, then moving the source to B/W).     There are three further considerations when resolving a deleted node:       If the BASE B/W/D was deleted explicitly *and* B/W is a replacement,      then the explicit deletion is subsumed by the implicit deletion that      occurred with the B/W replacement. Thus, BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will point      to B/W as the root of the BASE deletion. IOW, we can detect the      explicit move-away, but not an explicit deletion.       If B/W/D/N refers to a node present in the BASE tree, and B/W was      replaced by a shallow subtree, then it is possible for N to be      reported as deleted (from BASE) yet no deletions occurred in the      WORKING tree above N. Thus, WORK_DEL_ABSPATH will be set to NULL.      Summary of OUT parameters:     BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will specify the nearest ancestor of the explicit or    implicit deletion (if any) that applies to the BASE tree.     WORK_DEL_ABSPATH will specify the root of a deleted subtree within    the WORKING tree (note there is no concept of layered delete operations    in WORKING, so there is only one deletion root in the ancestry).     MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will specify the path where this node was moved to    if the node has moved-away.     If the node was moved-away, MOVED_TO_OP_ROOT_ABSPATH will specify the    target path of the root of the move operation.  If LOCAL_ABSPATH itself    is the source path of the root of the move operation, then    MOVED_TO_OP_ROOT_ABSPATH equals MOVED_TO_ABSPATH.     All OUT parameters may be set to NULL to indicate a lack of interest in    that piece of information.     If the node given by LOCAL_ABSPATH does not exist, then    SVN_ERR_WC_PATH_NOT_FOUND is returned. If it doesn't have a "deleted"    status, then SVN_ERR_WC_PATH_UNEXPECTED_STATUS will be returned.     All returned data will be allocated in RESULT_POOL. All temporary    allocations will be made in SCRATCH_POOL. */
