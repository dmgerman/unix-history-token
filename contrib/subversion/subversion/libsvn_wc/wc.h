comment|/* We can handle this format or anything lower, and we (should) error  * on anything higher.  *  * There is no format version 0; we started with 1.  *  * The bump to 2 introduced the ".svn-work" extension. For example,  *   ".svn/props/foo" became ".svn/props/foo.svn-work".  *  * The bump to 3 introduced the entry attribute  *   old-and-busted.c::ENTRIES_ATTR_ABSENT.  *  * The bump to 4 renamed the magic "svn:this_dir" entry name to "".  *  * == 1.0.x shipped with format 4  * == 1.1.x shipped with format 4  * == 1.2.x shipped with format 4  * == 1.3.x shipped with format 4  *  * The bump to 5 added support for replacing files with history (the  *   "revert base"). This was introduced in 1.4.0, but buggy until 1.4.6.  *  * The bump to 6 introduced caching of property modification state and  *   certain properties in the entries file.  *  * The bump to 7 changed the entries file format from XML to a custom  *   text-based format.  *  * The bump to 8 placed wcprops in one file per directory (named  *   upgrade.c::WCPROPS_ALL_DATA)  *  * == 1.4.x shipped with format 8  *  * The bump to 9 added changelists, keep-local, and sticky depth (for  *   selective/sparse checkouts) to each entry.  *  * == 1.5.x shipped with format 9  *  * The bump to 10 added tree-conflicts, file externals and a different  *   canonicalization of urls.  *  * == 1.6.x shipped with format 10  *  * The bump to 11 cleared the has_props, has_prop_mods, cachable_props,  *   and present_props values in the entries file. Older clients expect  *   proper values for these fields.  *  * The bump to 12 switched from 'entries' to the SQLite database 'wc.db'.  *  * The bump to 13 added the WORK_QUEUE table into 'wc.db', moved the  *   wcprops into the 'dav_cache' column in BASE_NODE, and stopped using  *   the 'incomplete_children' column of BASE_NODE.  *  * The bump to 14 added the WCLOCKS table (and migrated locks from the  *   filesystem into wc.db), and some columns to ACTUAL_NODE for future  *   use.  *  * The bump to 15 switched from depth='exclude' on directories to using  *   presence='exclude' within the BASE_NODE and WORKING_NODE tables.  *   This change also enabled exclude support on files and symlinks.  *  * The bump to 16 added 'locked_levels' to WC_LOCK, setting any existing  *   locks to a level of 0. The 'md5_checksum' column was added to PRISTINE  *   for future use.  *  * The bump to 17 added a '.svn/pristine' dir and moved the text bases into  *   the Pristine Store (the PRISTINE table and '.svn/pristine' dir), and  *   removed the '/.svn/text-base' dir.  *  * The bump to 18 moved the properties from separate files in the props and  *   prop-base directory (and .svn for the dir itself) into the wc.db file,  *   and then removed the props and prop-base dir.  *  * The bump to 19 introduced the 'single DB' per working copy. All metadata  *   is held in a single '.svn/wc.db' in the root directory of the working  *   copy. Bumped in r991236.  *  * The bump to 20 introduced NODES and drops BASE_NODE and WORKING_NODE,  *   op_depth is always 0 or 2. Bumped in r1005388.  *  * The bump to 21 moved tree conflict storage from the parent to the  *   conflicted node. Bumped in r1034436.  *  * The bump to 22 moved tree conflict storage from conflict_data column  *   to the tree_conflict_data column. Bumped in r1040255.  *  * The bump to 23 introduced multi-layer op_depth processing for NODES.  *   Bumped in r1044384.  *  * The bump to 24 started using the 'refcount' column of the PRISTINE table  *   correctly, instead of always setting it to '1'. Bumped in r1058523.  *  * The bump to 25 introduced the NODES_CURRENT view. Bumped in r1071283.  *  * The bump to 26 introduced the NODES_BASE view. Bumped in r1076617.  *  * The bump to 27 stored conflict files as relpaths rather than basenames.  *   Bumped in r1089593.  *  * The bump to 28 converted any remaining references to MD5 checksums  *   to SHA1 checksums. Bumped in r1095214.  *  * The bump to 29 renamed the pristine files from '<SHA1>' to '<SHA1>.svn-base'  * and introduced the EXTERNALS store. Bumped in r1129286.  *  * == 1.7.x shipped with format 29  *  * The bump to 30 switched the conflict storage to a skel inside conflict_data.  * Also clears some known invalid state. Bumped in r1387742.  *  * The bump to 31 added the inherited_props column in the NODES table.  * Bumped in r1395109.  *  * == 1.8.x shipped with format 31  *   * Please document any further format changes here.  */

comment|/* Prepare to merge a file content change into the working copy.     This does not merge properties; see svn_wc__merge_props() for that.    This does not necessarily change the file TARGET_ABSPATH on disk; it    may instead return work items that will replace the file on disk when    they are run.  ### Can we be more consistent about this?     Merge the difference between LEFT_ABSPATH and RIGHT_ABSPATH into    TARGET_ABSPATH.     Set *WORK_ITEMS to the appropriate work queue operations.     If there are any conflicts, append a conflict description to    *CONFLICT_SKEL.  (First allocate *CONFLICT_SKEL from RESULT_POOL if    it is initially NULL.  CONFLICT_SKEL itself must not be NULL.)    Also, unless it is considered to be a 'binary' file, mark any    conflicts in the text of the file TARGET_ABSPATH using LEFT_LABEL,    RIGHT_LABEL and TARGET_LABEL.     Set *MERGE_OUTCOME to indicate the result.     When DRY_RUN is true, no actual changes are made to the working copy.     If DIFF3_CMD is specified, the given external diff3 tool will    be used instead of our built in diff3 routines.     When MERGE_OPTIONS are specified, they are used by the internal    diff3 routines, or passed to the external diff3 tool.     WRI_ABSPATH describes in which working copy information should be    retrieved. (Interesting for merging file externals).     OLD_ACTUAL_PROPS is the set of actual properties before merging; used for    detranslating the file before merging.  This is necessary because, in    the case of updating, the update can have sent new properties, so we    cannot simply fetch and use the current actual properties.       ### Is OLD_ACTUAL_PROPS still necessary, now that we first prepare the          content change and property change and then apply them both to          the WC together?     Property changes sent by the update are provided in PROP_DIFF.     For a complete description, see svn_wc_merge5() for which this is    the (loggy) implementation.     *WORK_ITEMS will be allocated in RESULT_POOL. All temporary allocations    will be performed in SCRATCH_POOL. */
