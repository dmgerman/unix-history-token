On many systems, the BSD socket API does not provide the ability to    send packets to the 255.255.255.255 broadcast address, which can    prevent some clients (e.g., Win95) from seeing replies.   This is    not a problem on Solaris.     In addition, the BSD socket API will not work when more than one    network interface is configured on the server.     However, the BSD socket API is about as efficient as you can get, so if    the aforementioned problems do not matter to you, or if no other    API is supported for your system, you may want to go with it. */
