comment|/// ISD::NodeType enum - This enum defines the target-independent operators
comment|/// for a SelectionDAG.
comment|///
comment|/// Targets may also define target-dependent operator codes for SDNodes. For
comment|/// example, on x86, these are the enum values in the X86ISD namespace.
comment|/// Targets should aim to use target-independent operators to model their
comment|/// instruction sets as much as possible, and only use target-dependent
comment|/// operators when they have special requirements.
comment|///
comment|/// Finally, during and after selection proper, SNodes may use special
comment|/// operator codes that correspond directly with MachineInstr opcodes. These
comment|/// are used to represent selected instructions. See the isMachineOpcode()
comment|/// and getMachineOpcode() member functions of SDNode.

comment|/// SelectionDAG.  The register is available from the RegisterSDNode object.

comment|/// MERGE_VALUES - This node takes multiple discrete operands and returns
comment|/// them all as its individual results.  This nodes has exactly the same

name|SUBC
block|,
comment|/// Carry-using nodes for multiple precision addition and subtraction. These
comment|/// nodes take three operands: The first two are the normal lhs and rhs to

comment|/// produce two results; the normal result of the add or sub, and the output

block|,
comment|/// RESULT, BOOL = [SU]ADDO(LHS, RHS) - Overflow-aware nodes for addition.

comment|/// FCOPYSIGN(X, Y) - Return the value of X with the sign of Y.  NOTE: This
comment|/// DAG node does not require that X and Y have the same type, just that

comment|/// FCOPYSIGN(f32, f64) is allowed.

comment|/// BUILD_VECTOR(ELT0, ELT1, ELT2, ELT3,...) - Return a vector with the
comment|/// specified, possibly variable, elements.  The number of elements is
comment|/// required to be a power of two.  The types of the operands must all be
comment|/// the same and must match the vector element type, except that integer
comment|/// types are allowed to be larger than the element type, in which case
comment|/// the operands are implicitly truncated.
name|BUILD_VECTOR
block|,
comment|/// INSERT_VECTOR_ELT(VECTOR, VAL, IDX) - Returns VECTOR with the element
comment|/// at IDX replaced with VAL.  If the type of VAL is larger than the vector
comment|/// element type then VAL is truncated before replacement.
name|INSERT_VECTOR_ELT
block|,
comment|/// EXTRACT_VECTOR_ELT(VECTOR, IDX) - Returns a single element from VECTOR
comment|/// identified by the (potentially variable) element number IDX.  If the
comment|/// return type is an integer type larger than the element type of the
comment|/// vector, the result is extended to the width of the return type.
name|EXTRACT_VECTOR_ELT
block|,
comment|/// CONCAT_VECTORS(VECTOR0, VECTOR1, ...) - Given a number of values of

comment|/// INSERT_SUBVECTOR(VECTOR1, VECTOR2, IDX) - Returns a vector
comment|/// with VECTOR2 inserted into VECTOR1 at the (potentially
comment|/// variable) element number IDX, which must be a multiple of the

comment|/// IDX are overwritten with VECTOR2.  Elements IDX through

name|INSERT_SUBVECTOR
block|,
comment|/// EXTRACT_SUBVECTOR(VECTOR, IDX) - Returns a subvector from VECTOR (an
comment|/// vector value) starting with the element number IDX, which must be a
comment|/// constant multiple of the result vector length.
name|EXTRACT_SUBVECTOR
block|,
comment|/// VECTOR_SHUFFLE(VEC1, VEC2) - Returns a vector, of the same type as
comment|/// VEC1/VEC2.  A VECTOR_SHUFFLE node also contains an array of constant int
comment|/// values that indicate which value (or undef) each result element will
comment|/// get.  These constant ints are accessible through the

comment|/// in terms of the element size of VEC1/VEC2, not in terms of bytes.
name|VECTOR_SHUFFLE
block|,
comment|/// SCALAR_TO_VECTOR(VAL) - This represents the operation of loading a
comment|/// scalar value into element 0 of the resultant vector type.  The top
comment|/// elements 1 to N-1 of the N-element vector are undefined.  The type
comment|/// of the operand must match the vector element type, except when they

comment|/// the shift amount can be any type, but care must be taken to ensure it is

comment|/// to represent the shift amount.
comment|/// When the 1st operand is a vector, the shift amount must be in the same

name|SELECT
block|,
comment|/// Select with a vector condition (op #0) and two vector operands (ops #1
comment|/// and #2), returning a vector result.  All vectors have the same length.
comment|/// Much like the scalar select and setcc, each bit in the condition selects
comment|/// whether the corresponding result element is taken from op #1 or op #2.
comment|/// At first, the VSELECT condition is of vXi1 type. Later, targets may
comment|/// change the condition type in order to match the VSELECT node using a

name|VSELECT
block|,
comment|/// Select with condition operator - This selects between a true value and

comment|/// the lhs and rhs (ops #0 and #1) of a conditional expression with the
comment|/// condition code in op #4, a CondCodeSDNode.
name|SELECT_CC
block|,
comment|/// SetCC operator - This evaluates to a true value iff the condition is
comment|/// true.  If the result value type is not i1 then the high bits conform
comment|/// to getBooleanContents.  The operands to this are the left and right
comment|/// operands to compare (ops #0, and #1) and the condition code to compare
comment|/// them with (op #2) as a CondCodeSDNode. If the operands are vector types
comment|/// then the result type must also be a vector type.
name|SETCC
block|,
comment|/// Like SetCC, ops #0 and #1 are the LHS and RHS operands to compare, but
comment|/// op #2 is a *carry value*. This operator checks the result of

comment|/// Conversion operators.  These are all single input single output
comment|/// operations.  For all of these, the result type must be strictly

comment|/// with the 7th bit).  The size of the smaller type is indicated by the 1th

comment|/// ANY_EXTEND_VECTOR_INREG(Vector) - This operator represents an

comment|/// result type must have fewer elements than the operand type, and those
comment|/// elements must be larger integer types such that the total size of the
comment|/// operand type and the result type match. Each of the low operand

comment|/// BITCAST - This operator converts between integer, vector and FP
comment|/// values, as if the value was stored to memory with one type and loaded
comment|/// from the same address with the other type (or equivalently for vector
comment|/// format conversions, etc).  The source and result are required to have
comment|/// the same bit size (e.g.  f32<-> i32).  This can also be used for
comment|/// int-to-int or fp-to-fp conversions, but that is a noop, deleted by
comment|/// getNode().
comment|///
comment|/// This operator is subtly different from the bitcast instruction from
comment|/// LLVM-IR since this node may change the bits in the register. For
comment|/// example, this occurs on big-endian NEON and big-endian MSA where the
comment|/// layout of the bits in the register depends on the vector type and this
comment|/// operator acts as a shuffle operation for some vector type combinations.

comment|/// CONVERT_RNDSAT - This operator is used to support various conversions

comment|///              operand is always undefined. In addition to producing a

comment|///              store operation (i.e. the load / store does the address
comment|///              computation as well as performing the memory transaction).

comment|/// POST_INC     The effective address is the value of the base pointer. The
comment|/// POST_DEC     value of the offset operand is then added to / subtracted
comment|///              from the base after memory transaction. In addition to
