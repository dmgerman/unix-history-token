comment|/* If the program uses ELF-style shared libraries, then calls to    functions in shared libraries go through stubs, which live in a    table called the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table).  The first time the    function is called, the stub sends control to the dynamic linker,    which looks up the function's real address, patches the stub so    that future calls will go directly to the function, and then passes    control to the function.     If we are stepping at the source level, we don't want to see any of    this --- we just want to skip over the stub and the dynamic linker.    The simple approach is to single-step until control leaves the    dynamic linker.     However, on some systems (e.g., Red Hat's 5.2 distribution) the    dynamic linker calls functions in the shared C library, so you    can't tell from the PC alone whether the dynamic linker is still    running.  In this case, we use a step-resume breakpoint to get us    past the dynamic linker, as if we were using "next" to step over a    function call.     IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE says whether we're in the dynamic    linker code or not.  Normally, this means we single-step.  However,    if SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER then returns non-zero, then its value is an    address where we can place a step-resume breakpoint to get past the    linker's symbol resolution function.     IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE can generally be implemented in a    pretty portable way, by comparing the PC against the address ranges    of the dynamic linker's sections.     SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER is generally going to be system-specific, since    it depends on internal details of the dynamic linker.  It's usually    not too hard to figure out where to put a breakpoint, but it    certainly isn't portable.  SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER should do plenty of    sanity checking.  If it can't figure things out, returning zero and    getting the (possibly confusing) stepping behavior is better than    signalling an error, which will obscure the change in the    inferior's state.  */

However, any "raw" breakpoints must be removed from the list      (e.g., the solib bp's), since their address is probably invalid      now.       And, we DON'T want to call delete_breakpoints() here, since      that may write the bp's "shadow contents" (the instruction      value that was overwritten witha TRAP instruction).  Since      we now have a new a.out, those shadow contents aren't valid. */

This used to be      done in stop_stepping, however, setting prev_pc there did not handle      scenarios such as inferior function calls or returning from      a function via the return command.  In those cases, the prev_pc      value was not set properly for subsequent commands.  The prev_pc value       is used to initialize the starting line number in the ecs.  With an       invalid value, the gdb next command ends up stopping at the position      represented by the next line table entry past our start position.      On platforms that generate one line table entry per line, this      is not a problem.  However, on the ia64, the compiler generates      extraneous line table entries that do not increase the line number.      When we issue the gdb next command on the ia64 after an inferior call      or a return command, we often end up a few instructions forward, still       within the original line we started.       An attempt was made to have init_execution_control_state () refresh      the prev_pc value before calculating the line number.  This approach      did not work because on platforms that use ptrace, the pc register      cannot be read unless the inferior is stopped.  At that point, we      are not guaranteed the inferior is stopped and so the read_pc ()      call can fail.  Setting the prev_pc value here ensures the value is       updated correctly when the inferior is stopped.  */

comment|/* Wrapper for PC_IN_SIGTRAMP that takes care of the need to find the    function's name.     In a classic example of "left hand VS right hand", "infrun.c" was    trying to improve GDB's performance by caching the result of calls    to calls to find_pc_partial_funtion, while at the same time    find_pc_partial_function was also trying to ramp up performance by    caching its most recent return value.  The below makes the the    function find_pc_partial_function solely responsibile for    performance issues (the local cache that relied on a global    variable - arrrggg - deleted).     Using the testsuite and gcov, it was found that dropping the local    "infrun.c" cache and instead relying on find_pc_partial_function    increased the number of calls to 12000 (from 10000), but the number    of times find_pc_partial_function's cache missed (this is what    matters) was only increased by only 4 (to 3569).  (A quick back of    envelope caculation suggests that the extra 2000 function calls    @1000 extra instructions per call make the 1 MIP VAX testsuite run    take two extra seconds, oops :-)     Long term, this function can be eliminated, replaced by the code:    get_frame_type(current_frame()) == SIGTRAMP_FRAME (for new    architectures this is very cheap).  */

I don't know any specific target that generates      these signals at breakpoints (the code has been in GDB since at least      1992) so I can not guess how to handle them here.            In earlier versions of GDB, a target with HAVE_NONSTEPPABLE_WATCHPOINTS      would have the PC after hitting a watchpoint affected by      DECR_PC_AFTER_BREAK.  I haven't found any target with both of these set      in GDB history, and it seems unlikely to be correct, so      HAVE_NONSTEPPABLE_WATCHPOINTS is not checked here.  */

The software-single-step code needs      some modernization.       If we're not software-single-stepping, then we first check that there      is an enabled software breakpoint at this address.  If there is, and      we weren't using hardware-single-step, then we've hit the breakpoint.       If we were using hardware-single-step, we check prev_pc; if we just      stepped over an inserted software breakpoint, then we should decrement      the PC and eventually report hitting the breakpoint.  The prev_pc check      prevents us from decrementing the PC if we just stepped over a jump      instruction and landed on the instruction after a breakpoint.       The last bit checks that we didn't hit a breakpoint in a signal handler      without an intervening stop in sigtramp, which is detected by a new      stack pointer value below any usual function calling stack adjustments.       NOTE drow/2004-01-17: I'm not sure that this is necessary.  The check      predates checking for software single step at the same time.  Also,      if we've moved into a signal handler we should have seen the      signal.  */

comment|/* These syscall events are returned on HP-UX, as part of its          implementation of page-protection-based "hardware" watchpoints.          HP-UX has unfortunate interactions between page-protections and          some system calls.  Our solution is to disable hardware watches          when a system call is entered, and reenable them when the syscall          completes.  The downside of this is that we may miss the precise          point at which a watched piece of memory is modified.  "Oh well."           Note that we may have multiple threads running, which may each          enter syscalls at roughly the same time.  Since we don't have a          good notion currently of whether a watched piece of memory is          thread-private, we'd best not have any page-protections active          when any thread is in a syscall.  Thus, we only want to reenable          hardware watches when no threads are in a syscall.           Also, be careful not to try to gather much state about a thread          that's in a syscall.  It's frequently a losing proposition. */

Note that although the logical place to reenable h/w watches          is here, we cannot.  We cannot reenable them before stepping          the thread (this causes the next wait on the thread to hang).           Nor can we enable them after stepping until we've done a wait.

If the inferior    won't stop as a result of the signal -- i.e., if the signal is merely    a side-effect of something GDB's doing "under the covers" for the    user, such as stepping threads over a breakpoint they shouldn't stop    for -- then the message seems to be a serious annoyance at best.

If we were to evaluate the watchpoint expression          now, we would get the old value, and therefore no change          would seem to have occurred.           In order to make watchpoints work `right', we really need          to complete the memory write, and then evaluate the          watchpoint expression.  The following code does that by          removing the watchpoint (actually, all watchpoints and          breakpoints), single-stepping the target, re-inserting          watchpoints, and then falling through to let normal          single-step processing handle proceed.  Since this          includes evaluating watchpoints, things will come to a          stop in the correct manner.  */

Here we detect when a SIGILL or      SIGEMT is really a breakpoint and change it to SIGTRAP.  We do      something similar for SIGSEGV, since a SIGSEGV will be generated      when we're trying to execute a breakpoint instruction on a      non-executable stack.

If someone ever tries to get get call dummys on a          non-executable stack to work (where the target would stop          with something like a SIGSEGV), then those tests might need          to be re-instated.

This used to jump to step_over_function if we are stepping,          which is wrong.           Suppose the user does a `next' over a function call, and while          that call is in progress, the inferior receives a signal for          which GDB does not stop (i.e., signal_stop[SIG] is false).  In          that case, when we reach this point, there is already a          step-resume breakpoint established, right where it should be:          immediately after the function call the user is "next"-ing          over.  If we call step_over_function now, two bad things          happen:           - we'll create a new breakpoint, at wherever the current          frame's return address happens to be.  That could be          anywhere, depending on what function call happens to be on          the top of the stack at that point.  Point is, it's probably          not where we need it.           - the existing step-resume breakpoint (which is at the correct          address) will get orphaned: step_resume_breakpoint will point          to the new breakpoint, and the old step-resume breakpoint          will never be cleaned up.           The old behavior was meant to help HP-UX single-step out of          sigtramps.  It would place the new breakpoint at prev_pc, which          was certainly wrong.  I don't know the details there, so fixing          this probably breaks that.  As with anything else, it's up to          the HP-UX maintainer to furnish a fix that doesn't break other          platforms.  --JimB, 20 May 1999 */

I'm not sure we can without 	         cracking open the dld's shared libraries and sniffing 	         their unwind tables and text/data ranges, and that's 	         not a terribly portable notion.  	         Until that time, we must step the inferior out of the 	         dld callback, and also out of the dld itself (and any 	         code or stubs in libdld.sl, such as "shl_load" and 	         friends) until we reach non-dld code.  At that point, 	         we can stop stepping. */

On      FR-V, it's not permitted to place a breakpoint on any but the      first subinstruction of a VLIW instruction.

To do this, we set the step_resume bp's frame to our current    caller's frame (step_frame_id, which is set by the "next" or    "until" command, before execution begins).  */

comment|/* NOTE: cagney/2003-04-06:       The intent of DEPRECATED_SAVED_PC_AFTER_CALL was to:       - provide a very light weight equivalent to frame_unwind_pc()      (nee FRAME_SAVED_PC) that avoids the prologue analyzer       - avoid handling the case where the PC hasn't been saved in the      prologue analyzer       Unfortunately, not five lines further down, is a call to      get_frame_id() and that is guarenteed to trigger the prologue      analyzer.            The `correct fix' is for the prologe analyzer to handle the case      where the prologue is incomplete (PC in prologue) and,      consequently, the return pc has not yet been saved.  It should be      noted that the prologue analyzer needs to handle this case      anyway: frameless leaf functions that don't save the return PC;      single stepping through a prologue.       The d10v handles all this by bailing out of the prologue analsis      when it reaches the current instruction.  */
