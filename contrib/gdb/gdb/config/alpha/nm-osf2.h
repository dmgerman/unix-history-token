comment|/* Don't trace faults under OSF/1, rely on the posting of the appropriate    signal if fault tracing is disabled.    Tracing T_IFAULT under Alpha OSF/1 causes a `floating point enable'    fault from which we cannot continue (except by disabling the    tracing).    And as OSF/1 doesn't provide the standard fault definitions, the    mapping of faults to appropriate signals in procfs_wait is difficult.  */

comment|/* poll() doesn't seem to work properly for /proc in this version of the OS.    If we only specify POLLPRI, things hang.  It seems to get better when we set    POLLOUT, but that always returns POLLNVAL!!!  Also, POLLOUT causes problems    on other OSes.  */
