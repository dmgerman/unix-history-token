comment|/* The following text is taken from config/rs6000.mh:  * # The IBM version of /usr/include/rpc/rpc.h has a bug -- it says  * # `extern fd_set svc_fdset;' without ever defining the type fd_set.  * # Unfortunately this occurs in the vx-share code, which is not configured  * # like the rest of GDB (e.g. it doesn't include "defs.h").  * # We circumvent this bug by #define-ing fd_set here, but undefining it in  * # the xm-rs6000.h file before ordinary modules try to use it.  FIXME, IBM!  * MH_CFLAGS='-Dfd_set=int'  * So, here we do the undefine...which has to occur before we include  *<sys/select.h> below.  */
