comment|/* Simple implementation of vsprintf for systems without it.    Highly system-dependent, but should work on most "traditional"    implementations of stdio; newer ones should already have vsprintf.    Written by Per Bothner of Cygnus Support.    Based on libg++'s "form" (written by Doug Lea; dl@rocky.oswego.edu).    Copyright (C) 1991, 1995 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  This file is part of the libiberty library.
