comment|/*  * traceroute host  - trace the route ip packets follow going to "host".  *  * Attempt to trace the route an ip packet would follow to some  * internet host.  We find out intermediate hops by launching probe  * packets with a small ttl (time to live) then listening for an  * icmp "time exceeded" reply from a gateway.  We start our probes  * with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an icmp "port  * unreachable" (which means we got to "host") or hit a max (which  * defaults to net.inet.ip.ttl hops& can be changed with the -m flag).  * Three probes (change with -q flag) are sent at each ttl setting and  * a line is printed showing the ttl, address of the gateway and  * round trip time of each probe.  If the probe answers come from  * different gateways, the address of each responding system will  * be printed.  If there is no response within a 5 sec. timeout  * interval (changed with the -w flag), a "*" is printed for that  * probe.  *  * Probe packets are UDP format.  We don't want the destination  * host to process them so the destination port is set to an  * unlikely value (if some clod on the destination is using that  * value, it can be changed with the -p flag).  *  * A sample use might be:  *  *     [yak 71]% traceroute nis.nsf.net.  *     traceroute to nis.nsf.net (35.1.1.48), 64 hops max, 56 byte packet  *      1  helios.ee.lbl.gov (128.3.112.1)  19 ms  19 ms  0 ms  *      2  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  39 ms  39 ms  19 ms  *      3  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  39 ms  39 ms  19 ms  *      4  ccngw-ner-cc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.136.23)  39 ms  40 ms  39 ms  *      5  ccn-nerif22.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.168.22)  39 ms  39 ms  39 ms  *      6  128.32.197.4 (128.32.197.4)  40 ms  59 ms  59 ms  *      7  131.119.2.5 (131.119.2.5)  59 ms  59 ms  59 ms  *      8  129.140.70.13 (129.140.70.13)  99 ms  99 ms  80 ms  *      9  129.140.71.6 (129.140.71.6)  139 ms  239 ms  319 ms  *     10  129.140.81.7 (129.140.81.7)  220 ms  199 ms  199 ms  *     11  nic.merit.edu (35.1.1.48)  239 ms  239 ms  239 ms  *  * Note that lines 2& 3 are the same.

Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16& 17 hops away  * either don't send ICMP "time exceeded" messages or send them  * with a ttl too small to reach us.  14 - 17 are running the  * MIT C Gateway code that doesn't send "time exceeded"s.  God  * only knows what's going on with 12.  *  * The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in  * the 4.[23]BSD network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x<= 3)  * sends an unreachable message using whatever ttl remains in the  * original datagram.  Since, for gateways, the remaining ttl is  * zero, the icmp "time exceeded" is guaranteed to not make it back  * to us.  The behavior of this bug is slightly more interesting  * when it appears on the destination system:  *  *      1  helios.ee.lbl.gov (128.3.112.1)  0 ms  0 ms  0 ms  *      2  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  39 ms  19 ms  39 ms  *      3  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  19 ms  39 ms  19 ms  *      4  ccngw-ner-cc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.136.23)  39 ms  40 ms  19 ms  *      5  ccn-nerif35.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.168.35)  39 ms  39 ms  39 ms  *      6  csgw.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.133.254)  39 ms  59 ms  39 ms  *      7  * * *  *      8  * * *  *      9  * * *  *     10  * * *  *     11  * * *  *     12  * * *  *     13  rip.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.131.22)  59 ms !  39 ms !  39 ms !  *  * Notice that there are 12 "gateways" (13 is the final  * destination) and exactly the last half of them are "missing".  * What's really happening is that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5)  * is using the ttl from our arriving datagram as the ttl in its  * icmp reply.  So, the reply will time out on the return path  * (with no notice sent to anyone since icmp's aren't sent for  * icmp's) until we probe with a ttl that's at least twice the path  * length.  I.e., rip is really only 7 hops away.  A reply that  * returns with a ttl of 1 is a clue this problem exists.  * Traceroute prints a "!" after the time if the ttl is<= 1.  * Since vendors ship a lot of obsolete (DEC's Ultrix, Sun 3.x) or  * non-standard (HPUX) software, expect to see this problem  * frequently and/or take care picking the target host of your  * probes.  *  * Other possible annotations after the time are !H, !N, !P (got a host,  * network or protocol unreachable, respectively), !S or !F (source  * route failed or fragmentation needed -- neither of these should  * ever occur and the associated gateway is busted if you see one).  If  * almost all the probes result in some kind of unreachable, traceroute  * will give up and exit.  *  * Notes  * -----  * This program must be run by root or be setuid.  (I suggest that  * you *don't* make it setuid -- casual use could result in a lot  * of unnecessary traffic on our poor, congested nets.)  *  * This program requires a kernel mod that does not appear in any  * system available from Berkeley:  A raw ip socket using proto  * IPPROTO_RAW must interpret the data sent as an ip datagram (as  * opposed to data to be wrapped in a ip datagram).  See the README  * file that came with the source to this program for a description  * of the mods I made to /sys/netinet/raw_ip.c.  Your mileage may  * vary.  But, again, ANY 4.x (x< 4) BSD KERNEL WILL HAVE TO BE  * MODIFIED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM.  *  * The udp port usage may appear bizarre (well, ok, it is bizarre).  * The problem is that an icmp message only contains 8 bytes of  * data from the original datagram.  8 bytes is the size of a udp  * header so, if we want to associate replies with the original  * datagram, the necessary information must be encoded into the  * udp header (the ip id could be used but there's no way to  * interlock with the kernel's assignment of ip id's and, anyway,  * it would have taken a lot more kernel hacking to allow this  * code to set the ip id).  So, to allow two or more users to  * use traceroute simultaneously, we use this task's pid as the  * source port (the high bit is set to move the port number out  * of the "likely" range).  To keep track of which probe is being  * replied to (so times and/or hop counts don't get confused by a  * reply that was delayed in transit), we increment the destination  * port number before each probe.  *  * Don't use this as a coding example.  I was trying to find a  * routing problem and this code sort-of popped out after 48 hours  * without sleep.  I was amazed it ever compiled, much less ran.  *  * I stole the idea for this program from Steve Deering.  Since  * the first release, I've learned that had I attended the right  * IETF working group meetings, I also could have stolen it from Guy  * Almes or Matt Mathis.  I don't know (or care) who came up with  * the idea first.  I envy the originators' perspicacity and I'm  * glad they didn't keep the idea a secret.  *  * Tim Seaver, Ken Adelman and C. Philip Wood provided bug fixes and/or  * enhancements to the original distribution.  *  * I've hacked up a round-trip-route version of this that works by  * sending a loose-source-routed udp datagram through the destination  * back to yourself.  Unfortunately, SO many gateways botch source  * routing, the thing is almost worthless.  Maybe one day...  *  *  -- Van Jacobson (van@ee.lbl.gov)  *     Tue Dec 20 03:50:13 PST 1988  */
