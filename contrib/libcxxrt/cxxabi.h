comment|/**  * Structure used as a header on thrown exceptions.  This is the same layout as  * defined by the Itanium ABI spec, so should be interoperable with any other  * implementation of this spec, such as GNU libsupc++.  *  * This structure is allocated when an exception is thrown.  Unwinding happens  * in two phases, the first looks for a handler and the second installs the  * context.  This structure stores a cache of the handler location between  * phase 1 and phase 2.  Unfortunately, cleanup information is not cached, so  * must be looked up in both phases.  This happens for two reasons.  The first  * is that we don't know how many frames containing cleanups there will be, and  * we should avoid dynamic allocation during unwinding (the exception may be  * reporting that we've run out of memory).  The second is that finding  * cleanups is much cheaper than finding handlers, because we don't have to  * look at the type table at all.  *  * Note: Several fields of this structure have not-very-informative names.  * These are taken from the ABI spec and have not been changed to make it  * easier for people referring to to the spec while reading this code.  */
