comment|/* Structure for decoding tables.  Each entry provides either the    information needed to do the operation requested by the code that    indexed that table entry, or it provides a pointer to another    table that indexes more bits of the code.  op indicates whether    the entry is a pointer to another table, a literal, a length or    distance, an end-of-block, or an invalid code.  For a table    pointer, the low four bits of op is the number of index bits of    that table.  For a length or distance, the low four bits of op    is the number of extra bits to get after the code.  bits is    the number of bits in this code or part of the code to drop off    of the bit buffer.  val is the actual byte to output in the case    of a literal, the base length or distance, or the offset from    the current table to the next table.  Each entry is four bytes. */

comment|/* Maximum size of the dynamic table.  The maximum number of code structures is    1446, which is the sum of 852 for literal/length codes and 594 for distance    codes.  These values were found by exhaustive searches using the program    examples/enough.c found in the zlib distribtution.  The arguments to that    program are the number of symbols, the initial root table size, and the    maximum bit length of a code.  "enough 286 9 15" for literal/length codes    returns returns 852, and "enough 32 6 15" for distance codes returns 594.    The initial root table size (9 or 6) is found in the fifth argument of the    inflate_table() calls in infback9.c.  If the root table size is changed,    then these maximum sizes would be need to be recalculated and updated. */
