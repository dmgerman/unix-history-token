comment|/* acconfig.h    This file is in the public domain.     Descriptive text for the C preprocessor macros that    the distributed Autoconf macros can define.    No software package will use all of them; autoheader copies the ones    your configure.in uses into your configuration header file templates.     The entries are in sort -df order: alphabetical, case insensitive,    ignoring punctuation (such as underscores).  Although this order    can split up related entries, it makes it easier to check whether    a given entry is in the file.     Leave the following blank line there!!  Autoheader needs it.  */
