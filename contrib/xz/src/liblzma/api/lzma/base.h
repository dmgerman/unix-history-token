comment|/**  * \brief       Type of reserved enumeration variable in structures  *  * To avoid breaking library ABI when new features are added, several  * structures contain extra variables that may be used in future. Since  * sizeof(enum) can be different than sizeof(int), and sizeof(enum) may  * even vary depending on the range of enumeration constants, we specify  * a separate type to be used for reserved enumeration variables. All  * enumeration constants in liblzma API will be non-negative and less  * than 128, which should guarantee that the ABI won't break even when  * new constants are added to existing enumerations.  */
