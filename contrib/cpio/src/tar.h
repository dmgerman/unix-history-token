comment|/* The fields of header blocks:    All strings are stored as ISO 646 (approximately ASCII) strings.     Fields are numeric unless otherwise noted below; numbers are ISO 646    representations of octal numbers, with leading zeros as needed.     linkname is only valid when typeflag==LNKTYPE.  It doesn't use prefix;    files that are links to pathnames>100 chars long can not be stored    in a tar archive.     If typeflag=={LNKTYPE,SYMTYPE,DIRTYPE} then size must be 0.     devmajor and devminor are only valid for typeflag=={BLKTYPE,CHRTYPE}.     chksum contains the sum of all 512 bytes in the header block,    treating each byte as an 8-bit unsigned value and treating the    8 bytes of chksum as blank characters.     uname and gname are used in preference to uid and gid, if those    names exist locally.     Field Name	Byte Offset	Length in Bytes	Field Type    name		0		100		NUL-terminated if NUL fits    mode		100		8    uid		108		8    gid		116		8    size		124		12    mtime	136		12    chksum	148		8    typeflag	156		1		see below    linkname	157		100		NUL-terminated if NUL fits    magic	257		6		must be TMAGIC (NUL term.)    version	263		2		must be TVERSION    uname	265		32		NUL-terminated    gname	297		32		NUL-terminated    devmajor	329		8    devminor	337		8    prefix	345		155		NUL-terminated if NUL fits     If the first character of prefix is '\0', the file name is name;    otherwise, it is prefix/name.  Files whose pathnames don't fit in that    length can not be stored in a tar archive.  */
