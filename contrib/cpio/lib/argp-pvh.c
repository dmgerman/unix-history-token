comment|/* If set by the user program to a non-zero value, then a default option    --version is added (unless the ARGP_NO_HELP flag is used), which calls    this function with a stream to print the version to and a pointer to the    current parsing state, and then exits (unless the ARGP_NO_EXIT flag is    used).  This variable takes precedent over ARGP_PROGRAM_VERSION.  */
