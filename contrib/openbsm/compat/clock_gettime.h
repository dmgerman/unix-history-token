comment|/*  * Compatibility routines for clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, ...) for systems  * that don't have it.  We don't use clockid_t in order to avoid conflicts  * with the native OS if it has one but not clock_gettime().  We also assume  * that the sys/time.h include has already happened at this point, so we have  * access to gettimeofday().  */
