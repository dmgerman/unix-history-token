comment|/*  * this will fail if there is some problem with these file descriptors  * being allocated by the pam_filter Linux-PAM module. The numbers  * here are thought safe, but the filter developer should use the  * macros, as these numbers are subject to change.  *  * The APPXXX_FILENO file descriptors are the STDIN/OUT/ERR_FILENO of the  * application. The filter uses the STDIN/OUT/ERR_FILENO's to converse  * with the user, passes (modified) user input to the application via  * APPIN_FILENO, and receives application output from APPOUT_FILENO/ERR.  */
