comment|/*  * XXX - how should we distinguish Java from C++?  * The trick used in a Debian snapshot, of having "extends" or "implements"  * as tags for Java, doesn't work very well, given that those keywords  * are often preceded by "class", which flags it as C++.  *  * Perhaps we need to be able to say  *  *	If "class" then  *  *		if "extends" or "implements" then  *			Java  *		else  *			C++  *	endif  *  * Or should we use other keywords, such as "package" or "import"?  * Unfortunately, Ada95 uses "package", and Modula-3 uses "import",  * although I infer from the language spec at  *  *	http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/m3defn/html/m3.html  *  * that Modula-3 uses "IMPORT" rather than "import", i.e. it must be  * in all caps.  *  * So, for now, we go with "import".  We must put it before the C++  * stuff, so that we don't misidentify Java as C++.  Not using "package"  * means we won't identify stuff that defines a package but imports  * nothing; hopefully, very little Java code imports nothing (one of the  * reasons for doing OO programming is to import as much as possible  * and write only what you need to, right?).  *  * Unfortunately, "import" may cause us to misidentify English text  * as Java, as it comes after "the" and "The".  Perhaps we need a fancier  * heuristic to identify Java?  */
