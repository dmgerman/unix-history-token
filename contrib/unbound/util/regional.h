comment|/**  * \file  * Regional allocator. Allocates small portions of of larger chunks.  * Based on region-allocator from NSD, but rewritten to be light.  *  * Different from (nsd) region-allocator.h  * 	o does not have recycle bin  * 	o does not collect stats; just enough to answer get_mem() in use.  * 	o does not keep cleanup list  * 	o does not have function pointers to setup  * 	o allocs the regional struct inside the first block.  * 	o can take a block to create regional from.  * 	o blocks and large allocations are kept on singly linked lists.  */
