comment|/* The following numbers describe the earliest compatible version of    Perl ("compatibility" here being defined as sufficient binary/API    compatibility to run XS code built with the older version).    Normally this should not change across maintenance releases.     Note that this only refers to an out-of-the-box build.  Many non-default    options such as usemultiplicity tend to break binary compatibility    more often.     This is used by Configure et al to figure out     PERL_INC_VERSION_LIST, which lists version libraries    to include in @INC.  See INSTALL for how this works. */

comment|/* 	local_patches -- list of locally applied less-than-subversion patches. 	If you're distributing such a patch, please give it a name and a 	one-line description, placed just before the last NULL in the array 	below.  If your patch fixes a bug in the perlbug database, please 	mention the bugid.  If your patch *IS* dependent on a prior patch, 	please place your applied patch line after its dependencies. This 	will help tracking of patch dependencies.  	Please edit the hunk of diff which adds your patch to this list, 	to remove context lines which would give patch problems.  For instance, 	if the original context diff is 	   *** patchlevel.h.orig<date here> 	   --- patchlevel.h<date here> 	   *** 38,43 *** 	   --- 38,44 --- 	     	,"FOO1235 - some patch" 	     	,"BAR3141 - another patch" 	     	,"BAZ2718 - and another patch" 	   + 	,"MINE001 - my new patch" 	     	,NULL 	     }; 	 	please change it to  	   *** patchlevel.h.orig<date here> 	   --- patchlevel.h<date here> 	   *** 41,43 *** 	   --- 41,44 --- 	   + 	,"MINE001 - my new patch" 	     }; 	 	(Note changes to line numbers as well as removal of context lines.) 	This will prevent patch from choking if someone has previously 	applied different patches than you.  */
