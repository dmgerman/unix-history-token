Transmissions are made continuously on 3330 kHz,  * 7335 kHz and 14670 kHz in upper sideband, compatible AM mode. An  * ordinary shortwave receiver can be tuned manually to one of these  * frequencies or, in the case of ICOM receivers, the receiver can be  * tuned automatically using this program as propagation conditions  * change throughout the day and night.  *  * The driver receives, demodulates and decodes the radio signals when  * connected to the audio codec of a Sun workstation running SunOS or  * Solaris, and with a little help, other workstations with similar  * codecs or sound cards. In this implementation, only one audio driver  * and codec can be supported on a single machine.  *  * The driver can be compiled to use a Bell 103 compatible modem or  * modem chip to receive the radio signal and demodulate the data.  * Alternatively, the driver can be compiled to use the audio codec of  * the Sun workstation or another with compatible audio drivers. In the  * latter case, the driver implements the modem using DSP routines, so  * the radio can be connected directly to either the microphone on line  * input port. In either case, the driver decodes the data using a  * maximum likelihood technique which exploits the considerable degree  * of redundancy available to maximize accuracy and minimize errors.  *  * The CHU time broadcast includes an audio signal compatible with the  * Bell 103 modem standard (mark = 2225 Hz, space = 2025 Hz). It consist  * of nine, ten-character bursts transmitted at 300 bps and beginning  * each second from second 31 to second 39 of the minute. Each character  * consists of eight data bits plus one start bit and two stop bits to  * encode two hex digits. The burst data consist of five characters (ten  * hex digits) followed by a repeat of these characters. In format A,  * the characters are repeated in the same polarity; in format B, the  * characters are repeated in the opposite polarity.  *  * Format A bursts are sent at seconds 32 through 39 of the minute in  * hex digits  *  *	6dddhhmmss6dddhhmmss  *  * The first ten digits encode a frame marker (6) followed by the day  * (ddd), hour (hh in UTC), minute (mm) and the second (ss). Since  * format A bursts are sent during the third decade of seconds the tens  * digit of ss is always 3. The driver uses this to determine correct  * burst synchronization. These digits are then repeated with the same  * polarity.  *  * Format B bursts are sent at second 31 of the minute in hex digits  *  *	xdyyyyttaaxdyyyyttaa  *  * The first ten digits encode a code (x described below) followed by  * the DUT1 (d in deciseconds), Gregorian year (yyyy), difference TAI -  * UTC (tt) and daylight time indicator (aa) peculiar to Canada. These  * digits are then repeated with inverted polarity.  *  * The x is coded  *  * 1 Sign of DUT (0 = +)  * 2 Leap second warning. One second will be added.  * 4 Leap second warning. One second will be subtracted.  * 8 Even parity bit for this nibble.  *  * By design, the last stop bit of the last character in the burst  * coincides with 0.5 second. Since characters have 11 bits and are  * transmitted at 300 bps, the last stop bit of the first character  * coincides with 0.5 - 10 * 11/300 = 0.133 second. Depending on the  * UART, character interrupts can vary somewhere between the beginning  * of bit 9 and end of bit 11. These eccentricities can be corrected  * along with the radio propagation delay using fudge time 1.  *  * Debugging aids  *  * The timecode format used for debugging and data recording includes  * data helpful in diagnosing problems with the radio signal and serial  * connections. With debugging enabled (-d -d -d on the ntpd command  * line), the driver produces one line for each burst in two formats  * corresponding to format A and B. Following is format A:  *  *	n b f s m code  *  * where n is the number of characters in the burst (0-11), b the burst  * distance (0-40), f the field alignment (-1, 0, 1), s the  * synchronization distance (0-16), m the burst number (2-9) and code  * the burst characters as received. Note that the hex digits in each  * character are reversed, so the burst  *  *	10 38 0 16 9 06851292930685129293  *  * is interpreted as containing 11 characters with burst distance 38,  * field alignment 0, synchronization distance 16 and burst number 9.  * The nibble-swapped timecode shows day 58, hour 21, minute 29 and  * second 39.  *  * When the audio driver is compiled, format A is preceded by  * the current gain (0-255) and relative signal level (0-9999). The  * receiver folume control should be set so that the gain is somewhere  * near the middle of the range 0-255, which results in a signal level  * near 1000.  *  * Following is format B:  *   *	n b s code  *  * where n is the number of characters in the burst (0-11), b the burst  * distance (0-40), s the synchronization distance (0-40) and code the  * burst characters as received. Note that the hex digits in each  * character are reversed and the last ten digits inverted, so the burst  *  *	11 40 1091891300ef6e76ecff  *  * is interpreted as containing 11 characters with burst distance 40.  * The nibble-swapped timecode shows DUT1 +0.1 second, year 1998 and TAI  * - UTC 31 seconds.  *  * In addition to the above, the reference timecode is updated and  * written to the clockstats file and debug score after the last burst  * received in the minute. The format is  *  *	qq yyyy ddd hh:mm:ss nn dd tt  *  * where qq are the error flags, as described below, yyyy is the year,  * ddd the day, hh:mm:ss the time of day, nn the number of format A  * bursts received during the previous minute, dd the decoding distance  * and tt the number of timestamps. The error flags are cleared after  * every update.  *  * Fudge factors  *  * For accuracies better than the low millisceconds, fudge time1 can be  * set to the radio propagation delay from CHU to the receiver. This can  * be done conviently using the minimuf program. When the modem driver  * is compiled, fudge flag3 enables the ppsclock line discipline. Fudge  * flag4 causes the dubugging output described above to be recorded in  * the clockstats file.  *  * When the audio driver is compiled, fudge flag2 selects the audio  * input port, where 0 is the mike port (default) and 1 is the line-in  * port. It does not seem useful to select the compact disc player port.  * Fudge flag3 enables audio monitoring of the input signal. For this  * purpose, the speaker volume must be set before the driver is started.  *  * The ICOM code is normally compiled in the driver. It isn't used,  * unless the mode keyword on the server configuration command specifies  * a nonzero ICOM ID select code. The C-IV trace is turned on if the  * debug level is greater than one.  */

It uses a bandpass filter followed by a soft  * limiter, FM discriminator and lowpass filter. A maximum likelihood  * decoder samples the baseband signal at eight times the baud rate and  * detects the start bit of each character.  *  * The filters are built for speed, which explains the rather clumsy  * code.
