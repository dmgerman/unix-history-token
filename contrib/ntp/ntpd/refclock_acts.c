comment|/*  * This driver supports the NIST Automated Computer Time Service (ACTS).  * It periodically dials a prespecified telephone number, receives the  * NIST timecode data and calculates the local clock correction. It is  * designed primarily for use as a backup when neither a radio clock nor  * connectivity to Internet time servers is available. For the best  * accuracy, the individual telephone line/modem delay needs to be  * calibrated using outside sources.  *  * The ACTS is located at NIST Boulder, CO, telephone 303 494 4774. A  * toll call from a residence telephone in Newark, DE, costs between 14  * and 27 cents, depending on time of day, and from a campus telephone  * between 3 and 4 cents, although it is not clear what carrier and time  * of day discounts apply in this case. The modem dial string will  * differ depending on local telephone configuration, etc., and is  * specified by the phone command in the configuration file. The  * argument to this command is an AT command for a Hayes compatible  * modem.  *  * The accuracy produced by this driver should be in the range of a  * millisecond or two, but may need correction due to the delay  * characteristics of the individual modem involved. For undetermined  * reasons, some modems work with the ACTS echo-delay measurement scheme  * and some don't. This driver tries to do the best it can with what it  * gets. Initial experiments with a Practical Peripherals 9600SA modem  * here in Delaware suggest an accuracy of a millisecond or two can be  * achieved without the scheme by using a fudge time1 value of 65.0 ms.  * In either case, the dispersion for a single call involving ten  * samples is about 1.3 ms.  *  * The driver can operate in either of three modes, as determined by  * the mode parameter in the server configuration command. In mode 0  * (automatic) the driver operates continuously at intervals depending  * on the prediction error, as measured by the driver, usually in the  * order of several hours. In mode 1 (backup) the driver is enabled in  * automatic mode only when no other source of synchronization is  * available and when more than MAXOUTAGE (3600 s) have elapsed since  * last synchronized by other sources. In mode 2 (manual) the driver  * operates only when enabled using a fudge flags switch, as described  * below.  *  * For reliable call management, this driver requires a 1200-bps modem  * with a Hayes-compatible command set and control over the modem data  * terminal ready (DTR) control line. Present restrictions require the  * use of a POSIX-compatible programming interface, although other  * interfaces may work as well. The modem setup string is hard-coded in  * the driver and may require changes for nonstandard modems or special  * circumstances.  *  * Further information can be found in the README.refclock file in the  * ntp - Version 3 distribution.  *  * Fudge Factors  *  * Ordinarily, the propagation time correction is computed automatically  * by ACTS and the driver. When this is not possible or erratic due to  * individual modem characteristics, the fudge flag2 switch should be  * set to disable the ACTS echo-delay scheme. In any case, the fudge  * time1 parameter can be used to adjust the propagation delay as  * required.  *  * The ACTS call interval is determined in one of three ways. In manual  * mode a call is initiated by setting fudge flag1 using ntpdc, either  * manually or via a cron job. In AUTO mode this flag is set by the peer  * timer, which is controlled by the sys_poll variable in response to  * measured errors. In backup mode the driver is ordinarily asleep, but  * awakes (in auto mode) if all other synchronization sources are lost.  * In either auto or backup modes, the call interval increases as long  * as the measured errors do not exceed the value of the fudge time2  * parameter.  *  * When the fudge flag1 is set, the ACTS calling program is activated.  * This program dials each number listed in the phones command of the  * configuration file in turn. If a call attempt fails, the next number  * in the list is dialed. The fudge flag1 and counter are reset and the  * calling program terminated if (a) a valid clock update has been  * determined, (b) no more numbers remain in the list, (c) a device  * fault or timeout occurs or (d) fudge flag1 is reset manually using  * ntpdc.  *  * In automatic and backup modes, the driver determines the call  * interval using a procedure depending on the measured prediction  * error and the fudge time2 parameter. If the error exceeds time2 for a  * number of times depending on the current interval, the interval is  * decreased, but not less than about 1000 s. If the error is less than  * time2 for some number of times, the interval is increased, but not  * more than about 18 h. With the default value of zero for fudge time2,  * the interval will increase from 1000 s to the 4000-8000-s range, in  * which the expected accuracy should be in the 1-2-ms range. Setting  * fudge time2 to a large value, like 0.1 s, may result in errors of  * that order, but increase the call interval to the maximum. The exact  * value for each configuration will depend on the modem and operating  * system involved, so some experimentation may be necessary.  */

The count is decremented daily at 00  *		(UTC).  *	50	We are on DST.  *	51-99	Now on ST, go to DST when your local time is 2:00 am and  *		the count is 51. The count is decremented daily at 00  *		(UTC).  *  *	The two DST characters provide up to 48 days advance notice of a  *	change in time. The count remains at 00 or 50 at other times.  *  * LS	Leap second flag is set to "1" to indicate that a leap second is  *	to be added as 23:59:60 (UTC) on the last day of the current UTC  *	month. The LS flag will be reset to "0" starting with 23:59:60  *	(UTC). The flag will remain on for the entire month before the  *	second is added. Leap seconds are added as needed at the end of  *	any month. Usually June and/or December are chosen.  *  *	The leap second flag will be set to a "2" to indicate that a  *	leap second is to be deleted at 23:59:58--00:00:00 on the last  *	day of the current month. (This latter provision is included per  *	international recommendation, however it is not likely to be  *	required in the near future.)  *  * DUT1	Approximate difference between earth rotation time (UT1) and  *	UTC, in steps of 0.1 second: DUT1 = UT1 - UTC.  *  * MJD	Modified Julian Date, often used to tag certain scientific data.  *  * The full time format is sent at 1200 baud, 8 bit, 1 stop, no parity.  * The format at 300 Baud is also 8 bit, 1 stop, no parity. At 300 Baud  * the MJD and DUT1 values are deleted and the time is transmitted only  * on even seconds.  *  * Maximum on line time will be 56 seconds. If all lines are busy at any  * time, the oldest call will be terminated if it has been on line more  * than 28 seconds, otherwise, the call that first reaches 28 seconds  * will be terminated.  *  * Current time is valid at the "on-time" marker (OTM), either "*" or  * "#". The nominal on-time marker (*) will be transmitted 45 ms early  * to account for the 8 ms required to send 1 character at 1200 Baud,  * plus an additional 7 ms for delay from NIST to the user, and  * approximately 30 ms "scrambler" delay inherent in 1200 Baud modems.  * If the caller echoes all characters, NIST will measure the round trip  * delay and advance the on-time marker so that the midpoint of the stop  * bit arrives at the user on time. The amount of msADV will reflect the  * actual required advance in milliseconds and the OTM will be a "#".  *  * (The NIST system requires 4 or 5 consecutive delay measurements which  * are consistent before switching from "*" to "#". If the user has a  * 1200 Baud modem with the same internal delay as that used by NIST,  * then the "#" OTM should arrive at the user within +-2 ms of the  * correct time.  *  * However, NIST has studied different brands of 1200 Baud modems and  * found internal delays from 24 ms to 40 ms and offsets of the "#" OTM  * of +-10 ms. For many computer users, +-10 ms accuracy should be more  * than adequate since many computer internal clocks can only be set  * with granularity of 20 to 50 ms. In any case, the repeatability of  * the offset for the "#" OTM should be within +-2 ms, if the dial-up  * path is reciprocal and the user doesn't change the brand or model of  * modem used.  *  * This should be true even if the dial-up path on one day is a land-  * line of less than 40 ms (one way) and on the next day is a satellite  * link of 260 to 300 ms. In the rare event that the path is one way by  * satellite and the other way by land line with a round trip  * measurement in the range of 90 to 260 ms, the OTM will remain a "*"  * indicating 45 ms advance.  *  * For user comments write:  * NIST-ACTS  * Time and Frequency Division  * Mail Stop 847  * 325 Broadway  * Boulder, CO 80303  *  * Software for setting (PC)DOS compatable machines is available on a  * 360-kbyte diskette for $35.00 from: NIST Office of Standard Reference  * Materials B311-Chemistry Bldg, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899, (301)  * 975-6776  *  * PTB timecode service (+49 531 512038)  * The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (Germany)  * also supports a modem time service  * as the data formats are very similar this driver can also be compiled for  * utilizing the PTB time code service.  *  * Data format  * 0000000000111111111122222222223333333333444444444455555555556666666666777777777   7  * 0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678   9  * 1995-01-23 20:58:51 MEZ  10402303260219950123195849740+40000500              *  * A    B  C  D EF  G  H    IJ K  L M N O   P Q R S T    U V  W  XY             Z<CR><LF>  *  * A year  * B month  * C day  * D hour  * E : normally  *   A for DST to ST switch first hour  *   B for DST to ST switch second hour if not marked in H  * F minute  * G second  * H timezone  * I day of week  * J week of year  * K day of year  * L month for next ST/DST changes  * M day  * N hour  * O UTC year  * P UTC month  * Q UTC day  * R UTC hour  * S UTC minute  * T modified julian day (MJD)  * U DUT1  * V direction and month if leap second  * W signal delay (assumed/measured)  * X sequence number for additional text line in Y  * Y additional text  * Z on time marker (* - assumed delay / # measured delay)  *<CR>!<LF> ! is second change !  *  * This format is also used by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL)'s  * TRUETIME service in the UK.

Finaly, we unhook the 	 * timeout, arm for the next call, fold the tent and go home. 	 * The little dance with the '%' character is an undocumented 	 * ACTS feature that hangs up the phone real quick without 	 * waiting for carrier loss or long-space disconnect, but we do 	 * these clumsy things anyway. 	 */
