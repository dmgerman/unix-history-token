comment|/**    @mainpage    @section intro Introduction    Libevent is an event notification library for developing scalable network   servers.  The Libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback   function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a   timeout has been reached. Furthermore, Libevent also support callbacks due   to signals or regular timeouts.    Libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network   servers. An application just needs to call event_base_dispatch() and then add or   remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop.     Currently, Libevent supports /dev/poll, kqueue(2), select(2), poll(2),   epoll(4), and evports. The internal event mechanism is completely   independent of the exposed event API, and a simple update of Libevent can   provide new functionality without having to redesign the applications. As a   result, Libevent allows for portable application development and provides   the most scalable event notification mechanism available on an operating   system.  Libevent can also be used for multithreaded programs.  Libevent   should compile on Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris and, Windows.    @section usage Standard usage    Every program that uses Libevent must include the<event2/event.h>   header, and pass the -levent flag to the linker.  (You can instead link   -levent_core if you only want the main event and buffered IO-based code,   and don't want to link any protocol code.)    @section setup Library setup    Before you call any other Libevent functions, you need to set up the   library.  If you're going to use Libevent from multiple threads in a   multithreaded application, you need to initialize thread support --   typically by using evthread_use_pthreads() or   evthread_use_windows_threads().  See<event2/thread.h> for more   information.    This is also the point where you can replace Libevent's memory   management functions with event_set_mem_functions, and enable debug mode   with event_enable_debug_mode().    @section base Creating an event base    Next, you need to create an event_base structure, using event_base_new()   or event_base_new_with_config().  The event_base is responsible for   keeping track of which events are "pending" (that is to say, being   watched to see if they become active) and which events are "active".   Every event is associated with a single event_base.    @section event Event notification    For each file descriptor that you wish to monitor, you must create an   event structure with event_new().  (You may also declare an event   structure and call event_assign() to initialize the members of the   structure.)  To enable notification, you add the structure to the list   of monitored events by calling event_add().  The event structure must   remain allocated as long as it is active, so it should generally be   allocated on the heap.    @section loop Dispatching events.    Finally, you call event_base_dispatch() to loop and dispatch events.   You can also use event_base_loop() for more fine-grained control.    Currently, only one thread can be dispatching a given event_base at a   time.  If you want to run events in multiple threads at once, you can   either have a single event_base whose events add work to a work queue,   or you can create multiple event_base objects.    @section bufferevent I/O Buffers    Libevent provides a buffered I/O abstraction on top of the regular event   callbacks. This abstraction is called a bufferevent. A bufferevent   provides input and output buffers that get filled and drained   automatically. The user of a buffered event no longer deals directly   with the I/O, but instead is reading from input and writing to output   buffers.    Once initialized via bufferevent_socket_new(), the bufferevent structure   can be used repeatedly with bufferevent_enable() and   bufferevent_disable().  Instead of reading and writing directly to a   socket, you would call bufferevent_read() and bufferevent_write().    When read enabled the bufferevent will try to read from the file descriptor   and call the read callback. The write callback is executed whenever the   output buffer is drained below the write low watermark, which is 0 by   default.    See<event2/bufferevent*.h> for more information.    @section timers Timers    Libevent can also be used to create timers that invoke a callback after a   certain amount of time has expired. The evtimer_new() macro returns   an event struct to use as a timer. To activate the timer, call   evtimer_add(). Timers can be deactivated by calling evtimer_del().   (These macros are thin wrappers around event_new(), event_add(),   and event_del(); you can also use those instead.)    @section evdns Asynchronous DNS resolution    Libevent provides an asynchronous DNS resolver that should be used instead   of the standard DNS resolver functions.  See the<event2/dns.h>   functions for more detail.    @section evhttp Event-driven HTTP servers    Libevent provides a very simple event-driven HTTP server that can be   embedded in your program and used to service HTTP requests.    To use this capability, you need to include the<event2/http.h> header in your   program.  See that header for more information.    @section evrpc A framework for RPC servers and clients    Libevent provides a framework for creating RPC servers and clients.  It   takes care of marshaling and unmarshaling all data structures.    @section api API Reference    To browse the complete documentation of the libevent API, click on any of   the following links.    event2/event.h   The primary libevent header    event2/thread.h   Functions for use by multithreaded programs    event2/buffer.h and event2/bufferevent.h   Buffer management for network reading and writing    event2/util.h   Utility functions for portable nonblocking network code    event2/dns.h   Asynchronous DNS resolution    event2/http.h   An embedded libevent-based HTTP server    event2/rpc.h   A framework for creating RPC servers and clients   */

comment|/**  * @struct event  *  * Structure to represent a single event.  *  * An event can have some underlying condition it represents: a socket  * becoming readable or writeable (or both), or a signal becoming raised.  * (An event that represents no underlying condition is still useful: you  * can use one to implement a timer, or to communicate between threads.)  *  * Generally, you can create events with event_new(), then make them  * pending with event_add().  As your event_base runs, it will run the  * callbacks of an events whose conditions are triggered.  When you  * longer want the event, free it with event_free().  *  * In more depth:  *  * An event may be "pending" (one whose condition we are watching),  * "active" (one whose condition has triggered and whose callback is about  * to run), neither, or both.  Events come into existence via  * event_assign() or event_new(), and are then neither active nor pending.  *  * To make an event pending, pass it to event_add().  When doing so, you  * can also set a timeout for the event.  *  * Events become active during an event_base_loop() call when either their  * condition has triggered, or when their timeout has elapsed.  You can  * also activate an event manually using event_active().  The even_base  * loop will run the callbacks of active events; after it has done so, it  * marks them as no longer active.  *  * You can make an event non-pending by passing it to event_del().  This  * also makes the event non-active.  *  * Events can be "persistent" or "non-persistent".  A non-persistent event  * becomes non-pending as soon as it is triggered: thus, it only runs at  * most once per call to event_add().  A persistent event remains pending  * even when it becomes active: you'll need to event_del() it manually in  * order to make it non-pending.  When a persistent event with a timeout  * becomes active, its timeout is reset: this means you can use persistent  * events to implement periodic timeouts.  *  * This should be treated as an opaque structure; you should never read or  * write any of its fields directly.  For backward compatibility with old  * code, it is defined in the event2/event_struct.h header; including this  * header may make your code incompatible with other versions of Libevent.  *  * @see event_new(), event_free(), event_assign(), event_get_assignment(),  *    event_add(), event_del(), event_active(), event_pending(),  *    event_get_fd(), event_get_base(), event_get_events(),  *    event_get_callback(), event_get_callback_arg(),  *    event_priority_set()  */

If events contains one of EV_READ, EV_WRITE, or EV_READ|EV_WRITE, then   fd is a file descriptor or socket that should get monitored for   readiness to read, readiness to write, or readiness for either operation   (respectively).  If events contains EV_SIGNAL, then fd is a signal   number to wait for.  If events contains none of those flags, then the   event can be triggered only by a timeout or by manual activation with   event_active(): In this case, fd must be -1.    The EV_PERSIST flag can also be passed in the events argument: it makes   event_add() persistent until event_del() is called.    The EV_ET flag is compatible with EV_READ and EV_WRITE, and supported   only by certain backends.  It tells Libevent to use edge-triggered   events.    The EV_TIMEOUT flag has no effect here.    It is okay to have multiple events all listening on the same fds; but   they must either all be edge-triggered, or all not be edge triggerd.

comment|/**   Prepare a new, already-allocated event structure to be added.    The function event_assign() prepares the event structure ev to be used   in future calls to event_add() and event_del().  Unlike event_new(), it   doesn't allocate memory itself: it requires that you have already   allocated a struct event, probably on the heap.  Doing this will   typically make your code depend on the size of the event structure, and   thereby create incompatibility with future versions of Libevent.    The easiest way to avoid this problem is just to use event_new() and   event_free() instead.    A slightly harder way to future-proof your code is to use   event_get_struct_event_size() to determine the required size of an event   at runtime.    Note that it is NOT safe to call this function on an event that is   active or pending.  Doing so WILL corrupt internal data structures in   Libevent, and lead to strange, hard-to-diagnose bugs.  You _can_ use   event_assign to change an existing event, but only if it is not active   or pending!    The arguments for this function, and the behavior of the events that it   makes, are as for event_new().    @param ev an event struct to be modified   @param base the event base to which ev should be attached.   @param fd the file descriptor to be monitored   @param events desired events to monitor; can be EV_READ and/or EV_WRITE   @param callback callback function to be invoked when the event occurs   @param callback_arg an argument to be passed to the callback function    @return 0 if success, or -1 on invalid arguments.    @see event_new(), event_add(), event_del(), event_base_once(),     event_get_struct_event_size()   */

If you construct your events with EV_FINALIZE to avoid    deadlocks, you will need a way to remove an event in the certainty that    it will definitely not be running its callback when you deallocate it    and its callback argument.     To do this, call one of event_finalize() or event_free_finalize with    0 for its first argument, the event to tear down as its second argument,    and a callback function as its third argument.  The callback will be    invoked as part of the event loop, with the event's priority.     After you call a finalizer function, event_add() and event_active() will    no longer work on the event, and event_del() will produce a no-op. You    must not try to change the event's fields with event_assign() or    event_set() while the finalize callback is in progress.  Once the    callback has been invoked, you should treat the event structure as    containing uninitialized memory.     The event_free_finalize() function frees the event after it's finalized;    event_finalize() does not.     A finalizer callback must not make events pending or active.  It must not    add events, activate events, or attempt to "resucitate" the event being    finalized in any way.     THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL API.

However, some time it is desirable to process some events with a higher   priority than others.  For that reason, Libevent supports strict priority   queues.  Active events with a lower priority are always processed before   events with a higher priority.    The number of different priorities can be set initially with the   event_base_priority_init() function.  This function should be called   before the first call to event_base_dispatch().  The   event_priority_set() function can be used to assign a priority to an   event.  By default, Libevent assigns the middle priority to all events   unless their priority is explicitly set.    Note that urgent-priority events can starve less-urgent events: after   running all urgent-priority callbacks, Libevent checks for more urgent   events again, before running less-urgent events.  Less-urgent events   will not have their callbacks run until there are no events more urgent   than them that want to be active.    @param eb the event_base structure returned by event_base_new()   @param npriorities the maximum number of priorities   @return 0 if successful, or -1 if an error occurred   @see event_priority_set()  */

Libevent's default scheduling algorithm is optimized for having a large    number of timeouts with their durations more or less randomly    distributed.  But if you have a large number of timeouts that all have    the same duration (for example, if you have a large number of    connections that all have a 10-second timeout), then you can improve    Libevent's performance by telling Libevent about it.     To do this, call this function with the common duration.  It will return a    pointer to a different, opaque timeout value.  (Don't depend on its actual    contents!)  When you use this timeout value in event_add(), Libevent will    schedule the event more efficiently.     (This optimization probably will not be worthwhile until you have thousands    or tens of thousands of events with the same timeout.)  */
