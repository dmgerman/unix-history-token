Sup needs to send the file size, so that  * prevents running gzip in a pipeline (sigh).  *  * It now opens a temporary file, and immediately unlinks it.  It sends  * gzip's output to the temp file, and when gzip is done, it rewinds the  * file and sends it. When the last fd is closed, the file storage is  * reclaimed.  With luck, this will stop those 15MB  * gzip< emacs-19.30.tgz> /var/tmp/tmp.xxxx files from being left behind  * and blowing out /var on freefall.  *  * While I have the platform, let me quote a fortune entry which sup reminds  * me of:  "It is a crock of sh!t, and it stinks!"  *  * Revision 1.4  1996/02/06  19:03:58  pst  * make setproctitle display smaller  *  * Revision 1.3  1996/02/06 18:48:03  pst  * Setproctitle some useful information  *  * Revision 1.2  1995/12/26 05:03:11  peter  * Apply ports/net/sup/patches/patch-aa...  *  * Revision 1.1.1.1  1995/12/26 04:54:48  peter  * Import the unmodified version of the sup that we are using.  * The heritage of this version is not clear.  It appears to be NetBSD  * derived from some time ago.  *  * Revision 1.4  1994/08/11  02:46:26  rich  * Added extensions written by David Dawes.  From the man page:  *  * The -u flag, or the noupdate supfile option prevent updates from  * occurring for regular files where the modification time and mode  * hasn't changed.  *  * Now, how do we feed these patches back to CMU for consideration?  *  * Revision 1.3  1994/06/20  06:04:13  rgrimes  * Humm.. they did a lot of #if __STDC__ but failed to properly prototype  * the code.  Also fixed one bad argument to a wait3 call.  *  * It won't compile -Wall, but atleast it compiles standard without warnings  * now.  *  * Revision 1.2  1994/05/25  17:58:40  nate  * From Gene Stark  *  * system() returns non-zero status for errors, so check for non-zero  * status instead of< 0 which causes gzip/gunzip failures not to be noticed.  *  * Revision 1.1.1.1  1993/08/21  00:46:34  jkh  * Current sup with compression support.  *  * Revision 1.3  1993/06/05  21:32:17  cgd  * use daemon() to put supfilesrv into daemon mode...  *  * Revision 1.2  1993/05/24  17:57:31  brezak  * Remove netcrypt.c. Remove unneeded files. Cleanup make.  *  * Revision 1.20  92/09/09  22:05:00  mrt  * 	Added Brad's change to make sendfile take a va_list.  * 	Added support in login to accept an non-encrypted login  * 	message if no user or password is being sent. This supports  * 	a non-crypting version of sup. Also fixed to skip leading  * 	white space from crypts in host files.  * 	[92/09/01            mrt]  *   * Revision 1.19  92/08/11  12:07:59  mrt  * 		Made maxchildren a patchable variable, which can be set by the  * 		command line switch -C or else defaults to the MAXCHILDREN  * 		defined in sup.h. Added most of Brad's STUMP changes.  * 	Increased PGMVERSION to 12 to reflect substantial changes.  * 	[92/07/28            mrt]  *   * Revision 1.18  90/12/25  15:15:39  ern  * 	Yet another rewrite of the logging code. Make up the text we will write  * 	   and then get in, write it and get out.  * 	Also set error on write-to-full-disk if the logging is for recording  * 	   server is busy.  * 	[90/12/25  15:15:15  ern]  *   * Revision 1.17  90/05/07  09:31:13  dlc  * 	Sigh, some more fixes to the new "crypt" file handling code.  First,  * 	just because the "crypt" file is in a local file system does not mean  * 	it can be trusted.  We have to check for hard links to root owned  * 	files whose contents could be interpretted as a crypt key.  For  * 	checking this fact, the new routine stat_info_ok() was added.  This  * 	routine also makes other sanity checks, such as owner only permission,  * 	the file is a regular file, etc.  Also, even if the uid/gid of th  * 	"crypt" file is not going to be used, still use its contents in order  * 	to cause fewer surprises to people supping out of a shared file system  * 	such as AFS.  * 	[90/05/07            dlc]  *   * Revision 1.16  90/04/29  04:21:08  dlc  * 	Fixed logic bug in docrypt() which would not get the stat information  * 	from the crypt file if the crypt key had already been set from a  * 	"host" file.  * 	[90/04/29            dlc]  *   * Revision 1.15  90/04/18  19:51:27  dlc  * 	Added the new routines local_file(), link_nofollow() for use in  * 	dectecting whether a file is located in a local file system.  These  * 	routines probably should have been in another module, but only  * 	supfilesrv needs to do the check and none of its other modules seemed  * 	appropriate.  Note, the implementation should be changed once we have  * 	direct kernel support, for example the fstatfs(2) system call, for  * 	detecting the type of file system a file resides.  Also, I changed  * 	the routines which read the crosspatch crypt file or collection crypt  * 	file to save the uid and gid from the stat information obtained via  * 	the local_file() call (when the file is local) at the same time the  * 	crypt key is read.  This change disallows non-local files for the  * 	crypt key to plug a security hole involving the usage of the uid/gid  * 	of the crypt file to define who the the file server should run as.  If  * 	the saved uid/gid are both valid, then the server will set its uid/gid  * 	to these values.  * 	[90/04/18            dlc]  *   * Revision 1.14  89/08/23  14:56:15  gm0w  * 	Changed msgf routines to msg routines.  * 	[89/08/23            gm0w]  *   * Revision 1.13  89/08/03  19:57:33  mja  * 	Remove setaid() call.  *   * Revision 1.12  89/08/03  19:49:24  mja  * 	Updated to use v*printf() in place of _doprnt().  * 	[89/04/19            mja]  *   * 11-Sep-88  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added code to record release name in logfile.  *  * 18-Mar-88  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added host=<hostfile> support to releases file. [V7.12]  *  * 27-Dec-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added crosspatch support.  Created docrypt() routine for crypt  *	test message.  *  * 09-Sep-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Removed common information logging code, the quiet switch, and  *	moved samehost() check to after device/inode check.  *  * 28-Jun-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added code for "release" support. [V5.11]  *  * 26-May-87  Doug Philips (dwp) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added code to record final status of client in logfile. [V5.10]  *  * 22-May-87  Chriss Stephens (chriss) at Carnegie Mellon University  *	Mergered divergent CS and ECE versions. [V5.9a]  *  * 20-May-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Removed support for version 3 of SUP protocol.  Added changes  *	to make lint happy.  Added calls to new logging routines. [V5.9]  *  * 31-Mar-87  Dan Nydick (dan) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Fixed so no password check is done when crypts are used.  *  * 25-Nov-86  Rudy Nedved (ern) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Set F_APPEND fcntl in logging to increase the chance  *	that the log entry from this incarnation of the file  *	server will not be lost by another incarnation. [V5.8]  *  * 20-Oct-86  Dan Nydick (dan) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Changed not to call okmumbles when not compiled with CMUCS.  *  * 04-Aug-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added code to increment scmdebug as more -N flags are  *	added. [V5.7]  *  * 25-May-86  Jonathan J. Chew (jjc) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Renamed local variable in main program from "sigmask" to  *	"signalmask" to avoid name conflict with 4.3BSD identifier.  *	Conditionally compile in calls to CMU routines, "setaid" and  *	"logaccess". [V5.6]  *  * 21-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Changed supfilesrv to use the crypt file owner and group for  *	access purposes, rather than the directory containing the crypt  *	file. [V5.5]  *  * 07-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added code to keep logfiles in repository collection directory.  *	Added code for locking collections. [V5.4]  *  * 05-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added code to support new FSETUPBUSY return.  Now accepts all  *	connections and tells any clients after the 8th that the  *	fileserver is busy.  New clients will retry again later. [V5.3]  *  * 29-Dec-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Major rewrite for protocol version 4. [V4.2]  *  * 12-Dec-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Fixed close of crypt file to use file pointer as argument  *	instead of string pointer.  *  * 24-Nov-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Allow "!hostname" lines and comments in collection "host" file.  *  * 13-Nov-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Don't use access() on symbolic links since they may not point to  *	an existing file.  *  * 22-Oct-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Added code to restrict file server availability to when it has  *	less than or equal to eight children.  *  * 22-Sep-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Merged 4.1 and 4.2 versions together.  *  * 04-Jun-85  Steven Shafer (sas) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Created for 4.2 BSD.  *  **********************************************************************  */

comment|/*  * Determine whether the file referenced by the file descriptor 'handle' can  * be trusted, namely is it a file resident in the local file system.  *  * The main method of operation is to perform operations on the file  * descriptor so that an attempt to spoof the checks should fail, for  * example renamimg the file from underneath us and/or changing where the  * file lives from underneath us.  *  * returns: -1 for error, indicating that we can not tell  *	     0 for file is definately not local, or it is an RFS link  *	     1 for file is local and can be trusted  *  * Side effect: copies the stat information into the supplied buffer,  * regardless of the type of file system the file resides.  *  * Currently, the cases that we try to distinguish are RFS, AFS, NFS and  * UFS, where the latter is considered a trusted file.  We assume that the  * caller has disabled link following and will detect an attempt to access  * a file through an RFS link, except in the case the the last component is  * an RFS link.  With link following disabled, the last component itself is  * interpreted as a regular file if it is really an RFS link, so we  * disallow the RFS link identified by group "symlink" and mode "IEXEC by  * owner only". An AFS file is  * detected by trying the VIOCIGETCELL ioctl, which is one of the few AFS  * ioctls which operate on a file descriptor.  Note, this AFS ioctl is  * implemented in the cache manager, so the decision does not involve a  * query with the AFS file server.  An NFS file is detected by looking at  * the major device number and seeing if it matches the known values for  * MACH NSF/Sun OS 3.x or Sun OS 4.x.  *  * Having the fstatfs() system call would make this routine easier and  * more reliable.  *  * Note, in order to make the checks simpler, the file referenced by the  * file descriptor can not be a BSD style symlink.  Even with symlink  * following of the last path component disabled, the attempt to open a  * file which is a symlink will succeed, so we check for the BSD symlink  * file type here.  Also, the link following on/off and RFS file types  * are only relevant in a MACH environment.   */
