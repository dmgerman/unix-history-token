comment|/*  filecopy  --  copy a file from here to there  *  *  Usage:  i = filecopy (here,there);  *	int i, here, there;  *  *  Filecopy performs a fast copy of the file "here" to the  *  file "there".  Here and there are both file descriptors of  *  open files; here is open for input, and there for output.  *  Filecopy returns 0 if all is OK; -1 on error.  *  *  I have performed some tests for possible improvements to filecopy.  *  Using a buffer size of 10240 provides about a 1.5 times speedup  *  over 512 for a file of about 200,000 bytes.  Of course, other  *  buffer sized should also work; this is a rather arbitrary choice.  *  I have also tried inserting special startup code to attempt  *  to align either the input or the output file to lie on a  *  physical (512-byte) block boundary prior to the big loop,  *  but this presents only a small (about 5% speedup, so I've  *  canned that code.  The simple thing seems to be good enough.  *  *  HISTORY  * 20-Nov-79  Steven Shafer (sas) at Carnegie-Mellon University  *	Rewritten for VAX; same as "filcopy" on PDP-11.  Bigger buffer  *	size (20 physical blocks) seems to be a big win; aligning things  *	on block boundaries seems to be a negligible improvement at  *	considerable cost in complexity.  *  */
