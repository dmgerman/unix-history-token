comment|/*  * Routing Table Entry, one per subnet from which a multicast could originate.  * (Note: all addresses, subnet numbers and masks are kept in NETWORK order.)  *  * The Routing Table is stored as a singly-linked list of these structures,  * ordered by increasing value of rt_originmask and, secondarily, by  * increasing value of rt_origin within each rt_originmask value.  * This data structure is efficient for generating route reports, whether  * full or partial, for processing received full reports, for clearing the  * CHANGED flags, and for periodically advancing the timers in all routes.  * It is not so efficient for updating a small number of routes in response  * to a partial report.  In a stable topology, the latter are rare; if they  * turn out to be costing a lot, we can add an auxiliary hash table for  * faster access to arbitrary route entries.  */
