comment|/*  * mtrace.c  *  * This tool traces the branch of a multicast tree from a source to a  * receiver for a particular multicast group and gives statistics  * about packet rate and loss for each hop along the path.  It can  * usually be invoked just as  *  * 	mtrace source  *  * to trace the route from that source to the local host for a default  * group when only the route is desired and not group-specific packet  * counts.  See the usage line for more complex forms.  *  *  * Released 4 Apr 1995.  This program was adapted by Steve Casner  * (USC/ISI) from a prototype written by Ajit Thyagarajan (UDel and  * Xerox PARC).  It attempts to parallel in command syntax and output  * format the unicast traceroute program written by Van Jacobson (LBL)  * for the parts where that makes sense.  *   * Copyright (c) 1995 by the University of Southern California  * All rights reserved.  *  * Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its  * documentation in source and binary forms for any purposes and without  * fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice  * appear in all copies and that both the copyright notice and this  * permission notice appear in supporting documentation, and that any  * documentation, advertising materials, and other materials related to  * such distribution and use acknowledge that the software was developed  * by the University of Southern California, Information Sciences  * Institute.
