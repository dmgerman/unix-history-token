comment|/*   Data structures for recording monitored hosts    The information held by the status monitor comprises a list of hosts   that we have been asked to monitor, and, associated with each monitored   host, one or more clients to be called back if the monitored host crashes.    The list of monitored hosts must be retained over a crash, so that upon   re-boot we can call the SM_NOTIFY procedure in all those hosts so as to   cause them to start recovery processing.  On the other hand, the client   call-backs are not required to be preserved: they are assumed (in the   protocol design) to be local processes which will have crashed when   we did, and so are discarded on restart.    We handle this by keeping the list of monitored hosts in a file   (/var/statd.state) which is mmap()ed and whose format is described   by the typedef FileLayout.  The lists of client callbacks are chained   off this structure, but are held in normal memory and so will be   lost after a re-boot.  Hence the actual values of MonList * pointers   in the copy on disc have no significance, but their NULL/non-NULL   status indicates whether this host is actually being monitored or if it   is an empty slot in the file. */
