For each valid response received,  *		the procedure eachresult is called.  Its form is:  *	done = eachresult(resp, raddr)  *		bool_t done;  *		caddr_t resp;  *		struct sockaddr_in raddr;  *		where resp points to the results of the call and raddr is the  *		address if the responder to the broadcast.  */
