comment|/*  * The follow should be set to reflect the type of system you have:  *	JOBS -> 1 if you have Berkeley job control, 0 otherwise.  *	SYMLINKS -> 1 if your system includes symbolic links, 0 otherwise.  *	SHORTNAMES -> 1 if your linker cannot handle long names.  *	define BSD if you are running 4.2 BSD or later.  *	define SYSV if you are running under System V.  *	define DEBUG=1 to compile in debugging (set global "debug" to turn on)  *	define DEBUG=2 to compile in and turn on debugging.  *  * When debugging is on, debugging info will be written to $HOME/trace and  * a quit signal will generate a core dump.  */
