comment|/**  * Allocate memory and initialize the FPA pools using memory  * from cvmx-bootmem. Sizes of each element in the pools is  * controlled by the cvmx-config.h header file. Specifying  * zero for any parameter will cause that FPA pool to not be  * setup. This is useful if you aren't using some of the  * hardware and want to save memory.  *  * @param packet_buffers  *               Number of packet buffers to allocate  * @param work_queue_entries  *               Number of work queue entries  * @param pko_buffers  *               PKO Command buffers. You should at minimum have two per  *               each PKO queue.  * @param tim_buffers  *               TIM ring buffer command queues. At least two per timer bucket  *               is recommended.  * @param dfa_buffers  *               DFA command buffer. A relatively small (32 for example)  *               number should work.  * @return Zero on success, non-zero if out of memory  */
