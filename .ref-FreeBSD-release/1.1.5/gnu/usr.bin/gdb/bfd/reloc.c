comment|/* SECTION 	Relocations  	BFD maintains relocations in much the same was as it maintains 	symbols; they are left alone until required, then read in 	en-mass and traslated into an internal form. There is a common 	routine<<bfd_perform_relocation>> which acts upon the 	canonical form to do the actual fixup.  	Note that relocations are maintained on a per section basis, 	whilst symbols are maintained on a per BFD basis.  	All a back end has to do to fit the BFD interface is to create 	as many<<struct reloc_cache_entry>> as there are relocations 	in a particular section, and fill in the right bits:  @menu @* typedef arelent:: @* howto manager:: @end menu  */

comment|/* DESCRIPTION          Here is a description of each of the fields within a relent:          o sym_ptr_ptr          The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol         associated with the relocation request. This would naturally         be the pointer into the table returned by the back end's         get_symtab action. @xref{Symbols}. The symbol is referenced         through a pointer to a pointer so that tools like the linker         can fix up all the symbols of the same name by modifying only         one pointer. The relocation routine looks in the symbol and         uses the base of the section the symbol is attached to and the         value of the symbol as the initial relocation offset. If the         symbol pointer is zero, then the section provided is looked up.          o address          The address field gives the offset in bytes from the base of         the section data which owns the relocation record to the first         byte of relocatable information. The actual data relocated         will be relative to this point - for example, a relocation         type which modifies the bottom two bytes of a four byte word         would not touch the first byte pointed to in a big endian         world. 	 	o addend  	The addend is a value provided by the back end to be added (!) 	to the relocation offset. Its interpretation is dependent upon 	the howto. For example, on the 68k the code:   |        char foo[]; |        main() |                { |                return foo[0x12345678]; |                }          Could be compiled into:  |        linkw fp,#-4 |        moveb @@#12345678,d0 |        extbl d0 |        unlk fp |        rts           This could create a reloc pointing to foo, but leave the         offset in the data (something like)   |RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]: |offset   type      value  |00000006 32        _foo | |00000000 4e56 fffc          ; linkw fp,#-4 |00000004 1039 1234 5678     ; moveb @@#12345678,d0 |0000000a 49c0               ; extbl d0 |0000000c 4e5e               ; unlk fp |0000000e 4e75               ; rts           Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough         space in them to represent the full address range, and         pointers have to be loaded in two parts. So you'd get something like:   |        or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678) |        ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678) |        jmp      r1           This should create two relocs, both pointing to _foo, and with         0x12340000 in their addend field. The data would consist of:   |RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]: |offset   type      value  |00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000 |00000006 LVRT16    _foo+0x12340000  |00000000 5da05678           ; or.u r13,r0,0x5678 |00000004 1c4d5678           ; ld.b r2,r13,0x5678 |00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1           The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds         it to the addend to get the original offset and then adds the         value of _foo. Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around         somewhere, to cope with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.          One further example is the sparc and the a.out format. The         sparc has a similar problem to the 88k, in that some         instructions don't have room for an entire offset, but on the         sparc the parts are created odd sized lumps. The designers of         the a.out format chose not to use the data within the section         for storing part of the offset; all the offset is kept within         the reloc. Any thing in the data should be ignored.   |        save %sp,-112,%sp |        sethi %hi(_foo+0x12345678),%g2 |        ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0x12345678)],%i0 |        ret |        restore          Both relocs contains a pointer to foo, and the offsets would         contain junk.   |RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]: |offset   type      value  |00000004 HI22      _foo+0x12345678 |00000008 LO10      _foo+0x12345678  |00000000 9de3bf90     ; save %sp,-112,%sp |00000004 05000000     ; sethi %hi(_foo+0),%g2 |00000008 f048a000     ; ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0)],%i0 |0000000c 81c7e008     ; ret |00000010 81e80000     ; restore           o howto           The howto field can be imagined as a         relocation instruction. It is a pointer to a struct which         contains information on what to do with all the other         information in the reloc record and data section. A back end         would normally have a relocation instruction set and turn         relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input -         but it would be possible to create each howto field on demand.          */

There are two ways of reflecting the 	results of partial linkage in an output file; by modifying the 	output data in place, and by modifying the relocation record. 	Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and basic coff) have no 	way of specifying an addend in the relocation type, so the 	addend has to go in the output data.  This is no big deal 	since in these formats the output data slot will always be big 	enough for the addend. Complex reloc types with addends were 	invented to solve just this problem.  */

Pass one of these values to<<bfd_reloc_type_lookup>>, and it'll 	return a howto pointer.  	This does mean that the application must determine the correct 	enumerator value; you can't get a howto pointer from a random set 	of attributes.
