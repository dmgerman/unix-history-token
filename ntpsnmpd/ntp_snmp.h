comment|/*  * ntp_snmp.h -- common net-snmp header includes and workaround  *		 for Autoconf-related PACKAGE_* redefinitions between  *		 net-snmp and NTP.  *  * Currently ntpsnmpd *.c files are exceptions to the rule that every .c  * file should include<config.h> before any other headers.  It would be  * ideal to rearrange its includes so that our config.h is first, but  * that is complicated by the redefinitions between our config.h and  * net-snmp/net-snmp-config.h.  */
