comment|/*  * The tx_cpu structure is a per-cpu structure that is used to track  * the number of active transaction holds (tc_count). As transactions  * are assigned into a transaction group the appropriate tc_count is  * incremented to indicate that there are pending changes that have yet  * to quiesce. Consumers evenutally call txg_rele_to_sync() to decrement  * the tc_count. A transaction group is not considered quiesced until all  * tx_cpu structures have reached a tc_count of zero.  *  * This structure is a per-cpu structure by design. Updates to this structure  * are frequent and concurrent. Having a single structure would result in  * heavy lock contention so a per-cpu design was implemented. With the fanned  * out mutex design, consumers only need to lock the mutex associated with  * thread's cpu.  *  * The tx_cpu contains two locks, the tc_lock and tc_open_lock.  * The tc_lock is used to protect all members of the tx_cpu structure with  * the exception of the tc_open_lock. This lock should only be held for a  * short period of time, typically when updating the value of tc_count.  *  * The tc_open_lock protects the tx_open_txg member of the tx_state structure.  * This lock is used to ensure that transactions are only assigned into  * the current open transaction group. In order to move the current open  * transaction group to the quiesce phase, the txg_quiesce thread must  * grab all tc_open_locks, increment the tx_open_txg, and drop the locks.  * The tc_open_lock is held until the transaction is assigned into the  * transaction group. Typically, this is a short operation but if throttling  * is occuring it may be held for longer periods of time.  */

comment|/*  * The tx_state structure maintains the state information about the different  * stages of the pool's transcation groups. A per pool tx_state structure  * is used to track this information. The tx_state structure also points to  * an array of tx_cpu structures (described above). Although the tx_sync_lock  * is used to protect the members of this structure, it is not used to  * protect the tx_open_txg. Instead a special lock in the tx_cpu structure  * is used. Readers of tx_open_txg must grab the per-cpu tc_open_lock.  * Any thread wishing to update tx_open_txg must grab the tc_open_lock on  * every cpu (see txg_quiesce()).  */
