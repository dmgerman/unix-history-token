comment|/*  * The editor uses a temporary file for files being edited, in a structure  * similar to that of ed.  The first block of the file is used for a header  * block which guides recovery after editor/system crashes.  * Lines are represented in core by a pointer into the temporary file which  * is packed into 16 bits (32 on VMUNIX).  All but the low bit index the temp  * file; the last is used by global commands.  The parameters below control  * how much the other bits are shifted left before they index the temp file.  * Larger shifts give more slop in the temp file but allow larger files  * to be edited.  *  * The editor does not garbage collect the temporary file.  When a new  * file is edited, the temporary file is rather discarded and a new one  * created for the new file.  Garbage collection would be rather complicated  * in ex because of the general undo, and in any case would require more  * work when throwing lines away because marks would have be carefully  * checked before reallocating temporary file space.  Said another way,  * each time you create a new line in the temporary file you get a unique  * number back, and this is a property used by marks.  *  * The following temp file parameters allow 256k bytes in the temporary  * file.  By changing to the numbers in comments you can get 512k.  * For VMUNIX you get more than you could ever want.  * VMUNIX uses long (32 bit) integers giving much more  * space in the temp file and no waste.  This doubles core  * requirements but allows files of essentially unlimited size to be edited.  */

comment|/*  * The editor uses three buffers into the temporary file (ed uses two  * and is very similar).  These are two read buffers and one write buffer.  * Basically, the editor deals with the file as a sequence of BUFSIZ character  * blocks.  Each block contains some number of lines (and lines  * can run across block boundaries.  *  * New lines are written into the last block in the temporary file  * which is in core as obuf.  When a line is needed which isn't in obuf,  * then it is brought into an input buffer.  As there are two, the choice  * is to take the buffer into which the last read (of the two) didn't go.  * Thus this is a 2 buffer LRU replacement strategy.  Measurement  * shows that this saves roughly 25% of the buffer reads over a one  * input buffer strategy.  Since the editor (on our VAX over 1 week)  * spends (spent) roughly 30% of its time in the system read routine,  * this can be a big help.  */
