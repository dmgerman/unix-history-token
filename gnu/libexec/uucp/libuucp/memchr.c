comment|/* We tentatively exit the loop if adding MAGIC_BITS to 	 LONGWORD fails to change any of the hole bits of LONGWORD.  	 1) Is this safe?  Will it catch all the zero bytes? 	 Suppose there is a byte with all zeros.  Any carry bits 	 propagating from its left will fall into the hole at its 	 least significant bit and stop.  Since there will be no 	 carry from its most significant bit, the LSB of the 	 byte to the left will be unchanged, and the zero will be 	 detected.  	 2) Is this worthwhile?  Will it ignore everything except 	 zero bytes?  Suppose every byte of LONGWORD has a bit set 	 somewhere.  There will be a carry into bit 8.  If bit 8 	 is set, this will carry into bit 16.  If bit 8 is clear, 	 one of bits 9-15 must be set, so there will be a carry 	 into bit 16.  Similarly, there will be a carry into bit 	 24.  If one of bits 24-30 is set, there will be a carry 	 into bit 31, so all of the hole bits will be changed.  	 The one misfire occurs when bits 24-30 are clear and bit 	 31 is set; in this case, the hole at bit 31 is not 	 changed.  If we had access to the processor carry flag, 	 we could close this loophole by putting the fourth hole 	 at bit 32!  	 So it ignores everything except 128's, when they're aligned 	 properly.  	 3) But wait!  Aren't we looking for C, not zero? 	 Good point.  So what we do is XOR LONGWORD with a longword, 	 each of whose bytes is C.  This turns each byte that is C 	 into a zero.  */
