comment|/* Free memory allocated by uuconf_malloc.  If the memory block is    NULL, this just calls free; this is convenient for a number of    routines.  Otherwise, this will only do something if this was the    last buffer allocated for one of the memory blocks in the list; in    other cases, the memory is lost until the entire memory block is    freed.  */
