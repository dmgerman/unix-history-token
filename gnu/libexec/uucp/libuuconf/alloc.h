comment|/* We want to be able to keep track of allocated memory blocks, so    that we can free them up later.  This will let us free up all the    memory allocated to hold information for a system, for example.  We    do this by allocating large chunks and doling them out.  Calling    uuconf_malloc_block will return a pointer to a magic cookie which    can then be passed to uuconf_malloc and uuconf_free.  Passing the    pointer to uuconf_free_block will free all memory allocated for    that block.  */
