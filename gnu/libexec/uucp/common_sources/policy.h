comment|/* On some systems a write to a serial port will block even if the    file descriptor has been set to not block.  File transfer can be    more efficient if the package knows that a write to the serial port    will not block; however, if the write does block unexpectedly then    data loss is possible at high speeds.     If writes to a serial port always block even when requested not to,    you should set HAVE_UNBLOCKED_WRITES to 0; otherwise you should set    it to 1.  In general on System V releases without STREAMS-based    ttys (e.g., before SVR4) HAVE_UNBLOCKED_WRITES should be 0 and on    BSD or SVR4 it should be 1.     If HAVE_UNBLOCKED_WRITES is set to 1 when it should be 0 you may    see an unexpectedly large number of transmission errors, or, if you    have hardware handshaking, transfer times may be lower than    expected (but then, they always are).  If HAVE_UNBLOCKED_WRITES is    set to 0 when it should be 1, file transfer will use more CPU time    than necessary.  If you are unsure, setting HAVE_UNBLOCKED_WRITES    to 0 should always be safe.  */

On BSD this is typically the value of OBUFSIZ in<sys/tty.h>, usually 100.  On System V before SVR4 this is    typically the size of a clist, CLSIZE in<sys/tty.h>, which is    usually 64.  On SVR4, which uses STREAMS-based ttys, 2048 is    reasonable.  Define SINGLE_WRITE to the correct value for your    system.  If SINGLE_WRITE is too large, data loss may occur.  If    SINGLE_WRITE is too small, file transfer will use more CPU time    than necessary.  If you have no idea, 64 should work on most modern    systems.  */

On a true POSIX system (one which has the sysconf    function and also has _SC_CLK_TCK defined in<unistd.h>) TIMES_TICK    may simply be left as 0.  On some systems the environment variable    HZ is what you want for TIMES_TICK, but on some other systems HZ    has the wrong value; check the man page.  If you leave this set to    0, the code will try to guess; it will doubtless be wrong on some    non-POSIX systems.  If TIMES_TICK is wrong the code may report    incorrect file transfer times in the statistics file, but on many    systems times(2) will actually not be used and this value will not    matter at all.  */

This is typically done by creating a lock file in a    specific directory; the lock files are generally named    LCK..something or LK.something.  If the LOCKDIR macro is defined,    these lock files will be placed in the named directory; otherwise    they will be placed in the default spool directory.  On some HDB    systems the lock files are placed in /etc/locks.  On some they are    placed in /usr/spool/locks.  On the NeXT they are placed in    /usr/spool/uucp/LCK.  */

Check an existing lock    file to decide which of these choices is more appropriate.     The HDB style is to write the locking process ID in ASCII, passed    to ten characters, followed by a newline.     The V2 style is to write the locking process ID as four binary    bytes in the host byte order.  Many BSD derived systems use this    type of lock file, including the NeXT.     SCO lock files are similar to HDB lock files, but always lock the    lowercase version of the tty (i.e., LCK..tty2a is created if you    are locking tty2A).  They are appropriate if you are using Taylor    UUCP on an SCO Unix, SCO Xenix, or SCO Open Desktop system.     SVR4 lock files are also similar to HDB lock files, but they use a    different naming convention.  The filenames are LK.xxx.yyy.zzz,    where xxx is the major device number of the device holding the    special device file, yyy is the major device number of the port    device itself, and zzz is the minor device number of the port    device.     Coherent use a completely different method of terminal locking.    See unix/cohtty for details.  For locks other than for terminals,    HDB type lock files are used.  */

If    there is not enough space available on the disk (as determined by    DEFAULT_FREE_SPACE, above, or the ``free-space'' command for the    system) the communication will be aborted.  The disk will be    checked each time FREE_SPACE_DELTA bytes are received.  Lower    values of FREE_SPACE_DELTA are less likely to fill up the disk, but    will also waste more time checking the amount of free space.  To    avoid checking the disk while the file is being received, set    FREE_SPACE_DELTA to 0.  */
