comment|/* The following structure is used when comparing various alternatives    for overloading.  The unsigned quantity `strikes.i' is used    for fast comparison of two possibilities.  This number is an    aggregate of four constituents:       EVIL: if this is non-zero, then the candidate should not be considered      ELLIPSIS: if this is non-zero, then some actual argument has been matched                against an ellipsis      USER: if this is non-zero, then a user-defined type conversion is needed      B_OR_D: if this is non-zero, then use a base pointer instead of the              type of the pointer we started with.      EASY: if this is non-zero, then we have a builtin conversion            (such as int to long, int to float, etc) to do.     If two candidates require user-defined type conversions, and the    type conversions are not identical, then an ambiguity error    is reported.     If two candidates agree on user-defined type conversions,    and one uses pointers of strictly higher type (derived where    another uses base), then that alternative is silently chosen.     Note that this technique really only works for 255 arguments.  Perhaps    this is not enough.  */

This exists because $4.1 of the ARM states that something like      `short unsigned int' should promote to `int', not `unsigned int'.      If, for example, it tries to match two fns, f(int) and f(unsigned),      f(int) should be a better match than f(unsigned) by this rule.  Without      this extra metric, they both only appear as "integral promotions", which      will lead to an ambiguity.      For a TRIVIAL_CODE, This is also used by build_overload_call_real and      convert_harshness to keep track of other information we need.  */
