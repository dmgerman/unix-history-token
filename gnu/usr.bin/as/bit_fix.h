comment|/* The bit_fix was implemented to support machines that need variables    to be inserted in bitfields other than 1, 2 and 4 bytes.    Furthermore it gives us a possibillity to mask in bits in the symbol    when it's fixed in the objectcode and check the symbols limits.     The or-mask is used to set the huffman bits in displacements for the    ns32k port.    The acbi, addqi, movqi, cmpqi instruction requires an assembler that    can handle bitfields. Ie handle an expression, evaluate it and insert    the result in an some bitfield. ( ex: 5 bits in a short field of a opcode)    */
