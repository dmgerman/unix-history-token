comment|/*  * For every sub-segment the user mentions in the ASsembler program,  * we make one struct frchain. Each sub-segment has exactly one struct frchain  * and vice versa.  *  * Struct frchain's are forward chained (in ascending order of sub-segment  * code number). The chain runs through frch_next of each subsegment.  * This makes it hard to find a subsegment's frags  * if programmer uses a lot of them. Most programs only use text0 and  * data0, so they don't suffer. At least this way:  * (1)	There are no "arbitrary" restrictions on how many subsegments  *	can be programmed;  * (2)	Subsegments' frchain-s are (later) chained together in the order in  *	which they are emitted for object file viz text then data.  *  * From each struct frchain dangles a chain of struct frags. The frags  * represent code fragments, for that sub-segment, forward chained.  */
