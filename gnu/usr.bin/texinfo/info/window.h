We could define a structure which    contains this elements, and include that structure in each of WINDOW_STATE    and WINDOW.  But that would lead references in the code such as    window->state->node which we would like to avoid.  Instead, we #define the    elements here, and simply include the define in both data structures. Thus,    if you need to change window state information, here is where you would    do it.
