comment|/* SECTION 	Constructors  	Classes in C++ have @dfn{constructors} and @dfn{destructors}.  These 	are functions which are called automatically by the language 	whenever data of a class is created or destroyed.  Class data 	which is static may also be have a type which requires 	`construction'; the contructor must be called before the data 	can be referenced, so the contructor must be called before the 	program begins.   	The common solution to this problem is for the compiler to 	call a magic function as the first statement before<<main>>. 	This magic function (often called<<__main>>) runs around 	calling the constructors for all the things needing it.  	With COFF, the compiler has a bargain with the linker et al. 	All constructors are given strange names; for example,<<__GLOBAL__$I$foo>> might be the label of a contructor for 	the class @var{foo}.  The solution on unfortunate systems 	(most System V machines) is to perform a partial link on all 	the<<.o>> files, do an<<nm>> on the result, run<<awk>> or some 	such over the result looking for strange<<__GLOBAL__$>> 	symbols, generate a C program from this, compile it, and link 	with the partially linked input. This process is usually 	called<<collect>>.   	Some versions of<<a.out>> use something called the<<set_vector>> mechanism.  The constructor symbols are output 	from the compiler with a special stab code saying that they 	are constructors, and the linker can deal with them directly.   	BFD allows applications (i.e., the linker) to deal with 	constructor information independently of their external 	implementation by providing a set of entry points for the 	indiviual object back ends to call to maintain a database 	of the contructor information.  The application can 	interrogate the database to find out what it wants.  The 	construction data essential for the linker to be able to 	perform its job are:   	o asymbol - 	The asymbol of the contructor entry point contains all the 	information necessary to call the function.   	o table id - 	The type of symbol, i.e., is it a constructor, a destructor or 	something else someone dreamed up to make our lives difficult.  	The constructor module takes this information and builds extra 	sections attached to the BFDs which own the entry points.  It 	creates these sections as if they were tables of pointers to 	the entry points, and builds relocation entries to go with 	them so that the tables can be relocated along with the data 	they reference.   	These sections are marked with a special bit 	(<<SEC_CONSTRUCTOR>>), which the linker notices and does with 	what it wants.  */

comment|/* INTERNAL_FUNCTION 	bfd_constructor_entry   SYNOPSIS 	boolean bfd_constructor_entry(bfd *abfd,  		asymbol **symbol_ptr_ptr, 		CONST char*type);   DESCRIPTION 	@var{symbol_ptr_ptr} describes the 	function to be called; @var{type} descibes the xtor type, 	e.g., something like "CTOR" or "DTOR" would be fine.  @var{abfd} 	is the BFD which owns the function.  Create a section 	called "CTOR" or "DTOR" or whatever if the BFD doesn't already 	have one, and grow a relocation table for the entry points as 	they accumulate.  	Return<<true>> if successful,<<false>> if out of memory.  */
