comment|/* This version of `getopt' appears to the caller like standard Unix `getopt'    but it behaves differently for the user, since it allows the user    to intersperse the options with the other arguments.     As `getopt' works, it permutes the elements of `argv' so that,    when it is done, all the options precede everything else.  Thus    all application programs are extended to handle flexible argument order.     Setting the environment variable _POSIX_OPTION_ORDER disables permutation.    Then the behavior is completely standard.     GNU application programs can use a third alternative mode in which    they can distinguish the relative order of options and other arguments.  */

comment|/* Describe how to deal with options that follow non-option ARGV-elements.      UNSPECIFIED means the caller did not specify anything;     the default is then REQUIRE_ORDER if the environment variable     _OPTIONS_FIRST is defined, PERMUTE otherwise.      REQUIRE_ORDER means don't recognize them as options.     Stop option processing when the first non-option is seen.     This is what Unix does.      PERMUTE is the default.  We permute the contents of `argv' as we scan,     so that eventually all the options are at the end.  This allows options     to be given in any order, even with programs that were not written to     expect this.      RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were written     to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order and that care about     the ordering of the two.  We describe each non-option ARGV-element     as if it were the argument of an option with character code zero.     Using `-' as the first character of the list of option characters     requests this mode of operation.      The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless     of the value of `ordering'.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only     `--' can cause `getopt' to return EOF with `optind' != ARGC.  */
