comment|/**  * Constant time compare to memory regions. The reason for making it  * constant time is to make sure that timeing information leak from  * where in the function the diffrence is.  *  * ct_memcmp() can't be used to order memory regions like memcmp(),  * for example, use ct_memcmp() with qsort().  *  * @param p1 memory region 1 to compare  * @param p2 memory region 2 to compare  * @param len length of memory  *  * @return 0 when the memory regions are equal, non zero if not  *  * @ingroup roken  */
