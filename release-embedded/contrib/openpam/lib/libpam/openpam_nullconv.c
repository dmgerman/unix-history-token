comment|/**  * The =openpam_nullconv function is a null conversation function suitable  * for applications that want to use PAM but don't support interactive  * dialog with the user.  * Such applications should set =PAM_AUTHTOK to whatever authentication  * token they've obtained on their own before calling =pam_authenticate  * and / or =pam_chauthtok, and their PAM configuration should specify the  * ;use_first_pass option for all modules that require access to the  * authentication token, to make sure they use =PAM_AUTHTOK rather than  * try to query the user.  *  *>openpam_ttyconv  *>pam_prompt  *>pam_set_item  *>pam_vprompt  */
