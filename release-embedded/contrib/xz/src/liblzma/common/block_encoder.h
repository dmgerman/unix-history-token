comment|/// \brief      Biggest Compressed Size value that the Block encoder supports
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|///
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// The maximum size of a single Block is limited by the maximum size of
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// a Stream, which in theory is 2^63 - 3 bytes (i.e. LZMA_VLI_MAX - 3).
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// While the size is really big and no one should hit it in practice, we
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// take it into account in some places anyway to catch some errors e.g. if
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// application passes insanely big value to some function.
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|///
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// We could take into account the headers etc. to determine the exact
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// maximum size of the Compressed Data field, but the complexity would give
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// us nothing useful. Instead, limit the size of Compressed Data so that
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// even with biggest possible Block Header and Check fields the total
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// encoded size of the Block stays as a valid VLI. This doesn't guarantee
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// that the size of the Stream doesn't grow too big, but that problem is
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// taken care outside the Block handling code.
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|///
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// ~LZMA_VLI_C(3) is to guarantee that if we need padding at the end of
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|/// the Compressed Data field, it will still stay in the proper limit.
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|///
end_comment

begin_comment
