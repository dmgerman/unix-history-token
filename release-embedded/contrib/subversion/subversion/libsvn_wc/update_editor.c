comment|/*  * This code handles "checkout" and "update" and "switch".  * A checkout is similar to an update that is only adding new items.  *  * The intended behaviour of "update" and "switch", focusing on the checks  * to be made before applying a change, is:  *  *   For each incoming change:  *     if target is already in conflict or obstructed:  *       skip this change  *     else  *     if this action will cause a tree conflict:  *       record the tree conflict  *       skip this change  *     else:  *       make this change  *  * In more detail:  *  *   For each incoming change:  *  *   1.   if  # Incoming change is inside an item already in conflict:  *    a.    tree/text/prop change to node beneath tree-conflicted dir  *        then  # Skip all changes in this conflicted subtree [*1]:  *          do not update the Base nor the Working  *          notify "skipped because already in conflict" just once  *            for the whole conflicted subtree  *  *        if  # Incoming change affects an item already in conflict:  *    b.    tree/text/prop change to tree-conflicted dir/file, or  *    c.    tree change to a text/prop-conflicted file/dir, or  *    d.    text/prop change to a text/prop-conflicted file/dir [*2], or  *    e.    tree change to a dir tree containing any conflicts,  *        then  # Skip this change [*1]:  *          do not update the Base nor the Working  *          notify "skipped because already in conflict"  *  *   2.   if  # Incoming change affects an item that's "obstructed":  *    a.    on-disk node kind doesn't match recorded Working node kind  *            (including an absence/presence mis-match),  *        then  # Skip this change [*1]:  *          do not update the Base nor the Working  *          notify "skipped because obstructed"  *  *   3.   if  # Incoming change raises a tree conflict:  *    a.    tree/text/prop change to node beneath sched-delete dir, or  *    b.    tree/text/prop change to sched-delete dir/file, or  *    c.    text/prop change to tree-scheduled dir/file,  *        then  # Skip this change:  *          do not update the Base nor the Working [*3]  *          notify "tree conflict"  *  *   4.   Apply the change:  *          update the Base  *          update the Working, possibly raising text/prop conflicts  *          notify  *  * Notes:  *  *      "Tree change" here refers to an add or delete of the target node,  *      including the add or delete part of a copy or move or rename.  *  * [*1] We should skip changes to an entire node, as the base revision number  *      applies to the entire node. Not sure how this affects attempts to  *      handle text and prop changes separately.  *  * [*2] Details of which combinations of property and text changes conflict  *      are not specified here.  *  * [*3] For now, we skip the update, and require the user to:  *        - Modify the WC to be compatible with the incoming change;  *        - Mark the conflict as resolved;  *        - Repeat the update.  *      Ideally, it would be possible to resolve any conflict without  *      repeating the update. To achieve this, we would have to store the  *      necessary data at conflict detection time, and delay the update of  *      the Base until the time of resolving.  */

In the entries world this function shared a lot of code with the        update editor but in the wonderful new WC-NG world it will probably        do more and more by itself and would be more logically grouped with        the add/copy functionality in adm_ops.c and copy.c. */

Why an empty "new base"?           That happens in merge_tests.py 54,87,88,89,143.           In that case, having been given this supposed "new base" file, we          copy it and calculate its checksum but do not install it.  Why?          That must be wrong.           To crudely work around one issue with this, that we shouldn't          record a checksum in the database if we haven't installed the          corresponding pristine text, for now we'll just set the checksum          to NULL.           The proper solution is probably more like: the caller should pass          NULL for the missing information, and this function should learn to          handle that. */
