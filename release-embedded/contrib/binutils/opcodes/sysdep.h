comment|/* Do system-dependent stuff, mainly driven by autoconf-detected info.     Well, some generic common stuff is done here too, like including    ansidecl.h.  That's because the .h files in bfd/hosts files I'm    trying to replace often did that.  If it can be dropped from this    file (check in a non-ANSI environment!), it should be.  */
