comment|/*  * External entry point; should generally match name of .o file.  The  * arguments are always the same for all loaded modules.  The "load",  * "unload", and "stat" functions in "DISPATCH" will be called under  * their respective circumstances unless their value is "lkm_nullcmd".  If  * called, they are called with the same arguments (cmd is included to  * allow the use of a single function, ver is included for version  * matching between modules and the kernel loader for the modules).  *  * Since we expect to link in the kernel and add external symbols to  * the kernel symbol name space in a future version, generally all  * functions used in the implementation of a particular module should  * be static unless they are expected to be seen in other modules or  * to resolve unresolved symbols alread existing in the kernel (the  * second case is not likely to ever occur).  *  * The entry point should return 0 unless it is refusing load (in which  * case it should return an errno from errno.h).  */
