comment|/*  * Description of an archive entry.  *  * Basically, this is a "struct stat" with a few text fields added in.  *  * TODO: Add "comment", "charset", and possibly other entries  * that are supported by "pax interchange" format.  However, GNU, ustar,  * cpio, and other variants don't support these features, so they're not an  * excruciatingly high priority right now.  *  * TODO: "pax interchange" format allows essentially arbitrary  * key/value attributes to be attached to any entry.  Supporting  * such extensions may make this library useful for special  * applications (e.g., a package manager could attach special  * package-management attributes to each entry).  There are tricky  * API issues involved, so this is not going to happen until  * there's a real demand for it.  *  * TODO: Design a good API for handling sparse files.  */
