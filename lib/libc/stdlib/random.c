comment|/*  * random.c:  *  * An improved random number generation package.  In addition to the standard  * rand()/srand() like interface, this package also has a special state info  * interface.  The initstate() routine is called with a seed, an array of  * bytes, and a count of how many bytes are being passed in; this array is  * then initialized to contain information for random number generation with  * that much state information.  Good sizes for the amount of state  * information are 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes.  The state can be switched by  * calling the setstate() routine with the same array as was initiallized  * with initstate().  By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of state  * information and generates far better random numbers than a linear  * congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than  * 32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used.  *  * Internally, the state information is treated as an array of uint32_t's; the  * zeroeth element of the array is the type of R.N.G. being used (small  * integer); the remainder of the array is the state information for the  * R.N.G.  Thus, 32 bytes of state information will give 7 ints worth of  * state information, which will allow a degree seven polynomial.  (Note:  * the zeroeth word of state information also has some other information  * stored in it -- see setstate() for details).  *  * The random number generation technique is a linear feedback shift register  * approach, employing trinomials (since there are fewer terms to sum up that  * way).  In this approach, the least significant bit of all the numbers in  * the state table will act as a linear feedback shift register, and will  * have period 2^deg - 1 (where deg is the degree of the polynomial being  * used, assuming that the polynomial is irreducible and primitive).  The  * higher order bits will have longer periods, since their values are also  * influenced by pseudo-random carries out of the lower bits.  The total  * period of the generator is approximately deg*(2**deg - 1); thus doubling  * the amount of state information has a vast influence on the period of the  * generator.  Note: the deg*(2**deg - 1) is an approximation only good for  * large deg, when the period of the shift is the dominant factor.  * With deg equal to seven, the period is actually much longer than the  * 7*(2**7 - 1) predicted by this formula.  *  * Modified 28 December 1994 by Jacob S. Rosenberg.  * The following changes have been made:  * All references to the type u_int have been changed to unsigned long.  * All references to type int have been changed to type long.  Other  * cleanups have been made as well.  A warning for both initstate and  * setstate has been inserted to the effect that on Sparc platforms  * the 'arg_state' variable must be forced to begin on word boundaries.  * This can be easily done by casting a long integer array to char *.  * The overall logic has been left STRICTLY alone.  This software was  * tested on both a VAX and Sun SpacsStation with exactly the same  * results.  The new version and the original give IDENTICAL results.  * The new version is somewhat faster than the original.  As the  * documentation says:  "By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of  * state information and generates far better random numbers than a linear  * congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than  * 32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used."  For a buffer of  * 128 bytes, this new version runs about 19 percent faster and for a 16  * byte buffer it is about 5 percent faster.  */

This is done by multiplexing the pointer  * location into the zeroeth word of the state information.  *  * Note that due to the order in which things are done, it is OK to call  * setstate() with the same state as the current state.  *  * Returns a pointer to the old state information.  *  * Note: The Sparc platform requires that arg_state begin on an int  * word boundary; otherwise a bus error will occur. Even so, lint will  * complain about mis-alignment, but you should disregard these messages.  */

comment|/*  * random:  *  * If we are using the trivial TYPE_0 R.N.G., just do the old linear  * congruential bit.  Otherwise, we do our fancy trinomial stuff, which is  * the same in all the other cases due to all the global variables that have  * been set up.  The basic operation is to add the number at the rear pointer  * into the one at the front pointer.  Then both pointers are advanced to  * the next location cyclically in the table.  The value returned is the sum  * generated, reduced to 31 bits by throwing away the "least random" low bit.  *  * Note: the code takes advantage of the fact that both the front and  * rear pointers can't wrap on the same call by not testing the rear  * pointer if the front one has wrapped.  *  * Returns a 31-bit random number.  */
