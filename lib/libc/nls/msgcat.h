comment|/*  * Critical note here.  Sets and Messages *MUST* be stored in ascending  * order.  There are stored that way (by specification) in the original  * data file, however in the process of merging in new stuff you might  * mix that up.  Don't!  The catget stuff does a binary search and will  * totally lose it if these aren't in order (not contiguous mind you, just  * in order.  If this turns out to be a major problem this could be enhanced  * by adding a 'sorted' flag to the db, and sorting msgs and sets at load  * time if things aren't sorted, but I'd like not to have to do that.  */

comment|/*  * I have tried here to define data structures which can be used  * while the catalog is on disk, and at runtime.  * This is rather dangerous of course, but I think it can be done without  * overly increasing the memory usage, and it makes loading and storing  * somewhat simpler and less prone to accidents.  I have also tried to  * define on disk data structures which can be updated in place, so that  * with a very large catalog (e.g. all system errors) you don't have to  * load everything in memory in order to add or update one set.  With  * this in mind there are "invalid" flags which allow items to be  * invalidated and thus not loaded at runtime.  Note however that although  * I pay attention to these when I load the DB, I do not currently use  * them in gencat (it just reads everything into memory), so there is  * no guarantee that this will all work.  */
