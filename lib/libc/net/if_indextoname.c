comment|/*  * From RFC 2533:  *  * The second function maps an interface index into its corresponding  * name.  *  *    #include<net/if.h>  *  *    char  *if_indextoname(unsigned int ifindex, char *ifname);  *  * The ifname argument must point to a buffer of at least IF_NAMESIZE  * bytes into which the interface name corresponding to the specified  * index is returned.  (IF_NAMESIZE is also defined in<net/if.h> and  * its value includes a terminating null byte at the end of the  * interface name.) This pointer is also the return value of the  * function.  If there is no interface corresponding to the specified  * index, NULL is returned, and errno is set to ENXIO, if there was a  * system error (such as running out of memory), if_indextoname returns  * NULL and errno would be set to the proper value (e.g., ENOMEM).  */
