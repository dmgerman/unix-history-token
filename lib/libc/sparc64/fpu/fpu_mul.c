comment|/*  * The multiplication algorithm for normal numbers is as follows:  *  * The fraction of the product is built in the usual stepwise fashion.  * Each step consists of shifting the accumulator right one bit  * (maintaining any guard bits) and, if the next bit in y is set,  * adding the multiplicand (x) to the accumulator.  Then, in any case,  * we advance one bit leftward in y.  Algorithmically:  *  *	A = 0;  *	for (bit = 0; bit< FP_NMANT; bit++) {  *		sticky |= A& 1, A>>= 1;  *		if (Y& (1<< bit))  *			A += X;  *	}  *  * (X and Y here represent the mantissas of x and y respectively.)  * The resultant accumulator (A) is the product's mantissa.  It may  * be as large as 11.11111... in binary and hence may need to be  * shifted right, but at most one bit.  *  * Since we do not have efficient multiword arithmetic, we code the  * accumulator as four separate words, just like any other mantissa.  * We use local `register' variables in the hope that this is faster  * than memory.  We keep x->fp_mant in locals for the same reason.  *  * In the algorithm above, the bits in y are inspected one at a time.  * We will pick them up 32 at a time and then deal with those 32, one  * at a time.  Note, however, that we know several things about y:  *  *    - the guard and round bits at the bottom are sure to be zero;  *  *    - often many low bits are zero (y is often from a single or double  *	precision source);  *  *    - bit FP_NMANT-1 is set, and FP_1*2 fits in a word.  *  * We can also test for 32-zero-bits swiftly.  In this case, the center  * part of the loop---setting sticky, shifting A, and not adding---will  * run 32 times without adding X to A.  We can do a 32-bit shift faster  * by simply moving words.  Since zeros are common, we optimize this case.  * Furthermore, since A is initially zero, we can omit the shift as well  * until we reach a nonzero word.  */
