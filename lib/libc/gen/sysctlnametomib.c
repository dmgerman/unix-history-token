comment|/*  * This function uses a presently undocumented interface to the kernel  * to walk the tree and get the type so it can print the value.  * This interface is under work and consideration, and should probably  * be killed with a big axe by the first person who can find the time.  * (be aware though, that the proper interface isn't as obvious as it  * may seem, there are various conflicting requirements.  */
