comment|/**  * The =openpam_readlinev function reads a line from a file, splits it  * into words according to the rules described in the =openpam_readword  * manual page, and returns a list of those words.  *  * If =lineno is not =NULL, the integer variable it points to is  * incremented every time a newline character is read.  * This includes quoted or escaped newline characters and the newline  * character at the end of the line.  *  * If =lenp is not =NULL, the number of words on the line is stored in the  * variable to which it points.  *  * RETURN VALUES  *  * If successful, the =openpam_readlinev function returns a pointer to a  * dynamically allocated array of pointers to individual dynamically  * allocated NUL-terminated strings, each containing a single word, in the  * order in which they were encountered on the line.  * The array is terminated by a =NULL pointer.  *  * The caller is responsible for freeing both the array and the individual  * strings by passing each of them to =!free.  *  * If the end of the line was reached before any words were read,  * =openpam_readlinev returns a pointer to a dynamically allocated array  * containing a single =NULL pointer.  *  * The =openpam_readlinev function can fail and return =NULL for one of  * four reasons:  *  *  - The end of the file was reached before any words were read; :errno is  *    zero, =!ferror returns zero, and =!feof returns a non-zero value.  *  *  - The end of the file was reached while a quote or backslash escape  *    was in effect; :errno is set to =EINVAL, =!ferror returns zero, and  *    =!feof returns a non-zero value.  *  *  - An error occurred while reading from the file; :errno is non-zero,  *    =!ferror returns a non-zero value and =!feof returns zero.  *  *  - A =!malloc or =!realloc call failed; :errno is set to =ENOMEM,  *    =!ferror returns a non-zero value, and =!feof may or may not return  *    a non-zero value.  *  *>openpam_readline  *>openpam_readword  *  * AUTHOR DES  */
