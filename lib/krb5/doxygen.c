comment|/*! \mainpage Heimdal Kerberos 5 library  *  * \section intro Introduction  *  * Heimdal libkrb5 library is a implementation of the Kerberos  * protocol.  *   * Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a  * network.  It is built upon the assumption that the network is  * ``unsafe''.  For example, data sent over the network can be  * eavesdropped and altered, and addresses can also be faked.  * Therefore they cannot be used for authentication purposes.  *  * The project web page:\n  * http://www.h5l.org/  *  */
