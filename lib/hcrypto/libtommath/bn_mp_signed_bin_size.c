comment|/* LibTomMath, multiple-precision integer library -- Tom St Denis  *  * LibTomMath is a library that provides multiple-precision  * integer arithmetic as well as number theoretic functionality.  *  * The library was designed directly after the MPI library by  * Michael Fromberger but has been written from scratch with  * additional optimizations in place.  *  * The library is free for all purposes without any express  * guarantee it works.  *  * Tom St Denis, tomstdenis@gmail.com, http://libtom.org  */
