comment|/*  * Fused multiply-add: Compute x * y + z with a single rounding error.  *  * A double has more than twice as much precision than a float, so  * direct double-precision arithmetic suffices.  *  * XXX We are relying on the compiler to convert from double to float  *     using the current rounding mode and with the appropriate  *     side-effects.  But on at least one platform (gcc 3.4.2/sparc64),  *     this appears to be too much to ask for.  The precision  *     reduction should be done manually.  */
