comment|/*  * If type has more precision than dtype, the endpoints dtype_(min|max) are  * of the form xxx.5; they are "out of range" because lround() rounds away  * from 0.  On the other hand, if type has less precision than dtype, then  * all values that are out of range are integral, so we might as well assume  * that everything is in range.  (The correct condition in this case is  * harder to express.)  At compile time, INRANGE(x) should reduce to two  * floating-point comparisons in the former case, or TRUE otherwise.  */
