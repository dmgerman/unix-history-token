comment|/* Structure for decoding tables.  Each entry provides either the    information needed to do the operation requested by the code that    indexed that table entry, or it provides a pointer to another    table that indexes more bits of the code.  op indicates whether    the entry is a pointer to another table, a literal, a length or    distance, an end-of-block, or an invalid code.  For a table    pointer, the low four bits of op is the number of index bits of    that table.  For a length or distance, the low four bits of op    is the number of extra bits to get after the code.  bits is    the number of bits in this code or part of the code to drop off    of the bit buffer.  val is the actual byte to output in the case    of a literal, the base length or distance, or the offset from    the current table to the next table.  Each entry is four bytes. */

The maximum found in a long but non-    exhaustive search was 1004 code structures (850 for length/literals    and 154 for distances, the latter actually the result of an    exhaustive search).  The true maximum is not known, but the value    below is more than safe. */
