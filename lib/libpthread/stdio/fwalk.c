comment|/*  * fwalk now can only be used for flushing the buffers.  * This is all it was originally used for.  * The function has also become much more complicated.  * The first time through we flush everything we can.  * If this fails to flush everything because we couldn't get a lock  * we wait on the locksfor the second pass. Why this works ...  *   * This function must allow for multiple threads to flush everything.  * This function cannot flush buffers locked by another thread.  * So we flush everything we can the first pass. This includes all  * buffers locked by this thread, and wait on buffers that are locked.  * Eventually other threads willl unlock there buffers or flush them themselves  * at which point this thread will notice that it's empty or be able to  * flush the buffer. This is fine so long as no other thread tries to flush  * all buffers. Here is the possible deadlock condition, but since this thread  * has flushed all buffers it can, there are NO buffers locked by this thread  * that need flushing so any other thread flushing won't block waiting on this  * thread thereby eliminating the deadlock condition.  */
