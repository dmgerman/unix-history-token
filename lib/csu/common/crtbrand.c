comment|/*  * Special ".note" entry specifying the ABI version.  See  * http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/elf-notes.html  * for more information.  *  * For all arches except sparc, gcc emits the section directive for the  * following struct with a PROGBITS type.  However, newer versions of binutils  * (after 2.16.90) require the section to be of NOTE type, to guarantee that the  * .note.ABI-tag section correctly ends up in the first page of the final  * executable.  *  * Unfortunately, there is no clean way to tell gcc to use another section type,  * so this C file (or the C file that includes it) must be compiled in multiple  * steps:  *  * - Compile the .c file to a .s file.  * - Edit the .s file to change the 'progbits' type to 'note', for the section  *   directive that defines the .note.ABI-tag section.  * - Compile the .s file to an object file.  *  * These steps are done in the invididual Makefiles for each applicable arch.  */
