A standard Xen ring  *  buffer is used, with a datagram-based interface built on top.  The grant  *  reference and event channels are shared in XenStore under a user-specified  *  path.  *  *  The ring.h macros define an asymmetric interface to a shared data structure  *  that assumes all rings reside in a single contiguous memory space. This is  *  not suitable for vchan because the interface to the ring is symmetric except  *  for the setup. Unlike the producer-consumer rings defined in ring.h, the  *  size of the rings used in vchan are determined at execution time instead of  *  compile time, so the macros in ring.h cannot be used to access the rings.  */
