comment|/*  * Define the number of bits in each fraction and exponent.  *  *		     k	         k+1  * Note that  1.0 x 2  == 0.1 x 2      and that denorms are represented  *  *					  (-exp_bias+1)  * as fractions that look like 0.fffff x 2             .  This means that  *  *			 -126  * the number 0.10000 x 2    , for instance, is the same as the normalized  *  *		-127			   -128  * float 1.0 x 2    .  Thus, to represent 2    , we need one leading zero  *  *				  -129  * in the fraction; to represent 2    , we need two, and so on.  This  *  *						     (-exp_bias-fracbits+1)  * implies that the smallest denormalized number is 2  *  * for whichever format we are talking about: for single precision, for  *  *						-126		-149  * instance, we get .00000000000000000000001 x 2    , or 1.0 x 2    , and  *  * -149 == -127 - 23 + 1.  */
