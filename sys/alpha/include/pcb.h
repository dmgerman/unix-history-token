comment|/*  * PCB: process control block  *  * In this case, the hardware structure that is the defining element  * for a process, and the additional state that must be saved by software  * on a context switch.  Fields marked [HW] are mandated by hardware; fields  * marked [SW] are for the software.  *  * It's said in the VMS PALcode section of the AARM that the pcb address  * passed to the swpctx PALcode call has to be a physical address.  Not  * knowing this (and trying a virtual) address proved this correct.  * So we cache the physical address of the pcb in the md_proc struct.  */
