comment|/*  * The SPXT_REXMT timer is used to force retransmissions.  * The SPX has the SPXT_REXMT timer set whenever segments  * have been sent for which ACKs are expected but not yet  * received.  If an ACK is received which advances tp->snd_una,  * then the retransmit timer is cleared (if there are no more  * outstanding segments) or reset to the base value (if there  * are more ACKs expected).  Whenever the retransmit timer goes off,  * we retransmit one unacknowledged segment, and do a backoff  * on the retransmit timer.  *  * The SPXT_PERSIST timer is used to keep window size information  * flowing even if the window goes shut.  If all previous transmissions  * have been acknowledged (so that there are no retransmissions in progress),  * and the window is too small to bother sending anything, then we start  * the SPXT_PERSIST timer.  When it expires, if the window is nonzero,  * we go to transmit state.  Otherwise, at intervals send a single byte  * into the peer's window to force him to update our window information.  * We do this at most as often as SPXT_PERSMIN time intervals,  * but no more frequently than the current estimate of round-trip  * packet time.  The SPXT_PERSIST timer is cleared whenever we receive  * a window update from the peer.  *  * The SPXT_KEEP timer is used to keep connections alive.  If an  * connection is idle (no segments received) for SPXTV_KEEP amount of time,  * but not yet established, then we drop the connection.  If the connection  * is established, then we force the peer to send us a segment by sending:  *<SEQ=SND.UNA-1><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>  * This segment is (deliberately) outside the window, and should elicit  * an ack segment in response from the peer.  If, despite the SPXT_KEEP  * initiated segments we cannot elicit a response from a peer in SPXT_MAXIDLE  * amount of time, then we drop the connection.  */
