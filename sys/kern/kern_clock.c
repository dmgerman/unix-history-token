The main clock, running hz times per second, is used to keep  * track of real time.  The second timer handles kernel and user profiling,  * and does resource use estimation.  If the second timer is programmable,  * it is randomized to avoid aliasing between the two clocks.  For example,  * the randomization prevents an adversary from always giving up the cpu  * just before its quantum expires.  Otherwise, it would never accumulate  * cpu ticks.  The mean frequency of the second timer is stathz.  *  * If no second timer exists, stathz will be zero; in this case we drive  * profiling and statistics off the main clock.  This WILL NOT be accurate;  * do not do it unless absolutely necessary.  *  * The statistics clock may (or may not) be run at a higher rate while  * profiling.  This profile clock runs at profhz.  We require that profhz  * be an integral multiple of stathz.  *  * If the statistics clock is running fast, it must be divided by the ratio  * profhz/stathz for statistics.  (For profiling, every tick counts.)  */
