comment|/*    Inflate deflated (PKZIP's method 8 compressed) data.  The compression    method searches for as much of the current string of bytes (up to a    length of 258) in the previous 32K bytes.  If it doesn't find any    matches (of at least length 3), it codes the next byte.  Otherwise, it    codes the length of the matched string and its distance backwards from    the current position.  There is a single Huffman code that codes both    single bytes (called "literals") and match lengths.  A second Huffman    code codes the distance information, which follows a length code.  Each    length or distance code actually represents a base value and a number    of "extra" (sometimes zero) bits to get to add to the base value.  At    the end of each deflated block is a special end-of-block (EOB) literal/    length code.  The decoding process is basically: get a literal/length    code; if EOB then done; if a literal, emit the decoded byte; if a    length then get the distance and emit the referred-to bytes from the    sliding window of previously emitted data.     There are (currently) three kinds of inflate blocks: stored, fixed, and    dynamic.  The compressor outputs a chunk of data at a time and decides    which method to use on a chunk-by-chunk basis.  A chunk might typically    be 32K to 64K, uncompressed.  If the chunk is uncompressible, then the    "stored" method is used.  In this case, the bytes are simply stored as    is, eight bits per byte, with none of the above coding.  The bytes are    preceded by a count, since there is no longer an EOB code.     If the data is compressible, then either the fixed or dynamic methods    are used.  In the dynamic method, the compressed data is preceded by    an encoding of the literal/length and distance Huffman codes that are    to be used to decode this block.  The representation is itself Huffman    coded, and so is preceded by a description of that code.  These code    descriptions take up a little space, and so for small blocks, there is    a predefined set of codes, called the fixed codes.  The fixed method is    used if the block ends up smaller that way (usually for quite small    chunks); otherwise the dynamic method is used.  In the latter case, the    codes are customized to the probabilities in the current block and so    can code it much better than the pre-determined fixed codes can.     The Huffman codes themselves are decoded using a mutli-level table    lookup, in order to maximize the speed of decoding plus the speed of    building the decoding tables.  See the comments below that precede the    lbits and dbits tuning parameters.  */

comment|/*    Notes beyond the 1.93a appnote.txt:     1. Distance pointers never point before the beginning of the output       stream.    2. Distance pointers can point back across blocks, up to 32k away.    3. There is an implied maximum of 7 bits for the bit length table and       15 bits for the actual data.    4. If only one code exists, then it is encoded using one bit.  (Zero       would be more efficient, but perhaps a little confusing.)  If two       codes exist, they are coded using one bit each (0 and 1).    5. There is no way of sending zero distance codes--a dummy must be       sent if there are none.  (History: a pre 2.0 version of PKZIP would       store blocks with no distance codes, but this was discovered to be       too harsh a criterion.)  Valid only for 1.93a.  2.04c does allow       zero distance codes, which is sent as one code of zero bits in       length.    6. There are up to 286 literal/length codes.  Code 256 represents the       end-of-block.  Note however that the static length tree defines       288 codes just to fill out the Huffman codes.  Codes 286 and 287       cannot be used though, since there is no length base or extra bits       defined for them.  Similarily, there are up to 30 distance codes.       However, static trees define 32 codes (all 5 bits) to fill out the       Huffman codes, but the last two had better not show up in the data.    7. Unzip can check dynamic Huffman blocks for complete code sets.       The exception is that a single code would not be complete (see #4).    8. The five bits following the block type is really the number of       literal codes sent minus 257.    9. Length codes 8,16,16 are interpreted as 13 length codes of 8 bits       (1+6+6).  Therefore, to output three times the length, you output       three codes (1+1+1), whereas to output four times the same length,       you only need two codes (1+3).  Hmm.   10. In the tree reconstruction algorithm, Code = Code + Increment       only if BitLength(i) is not zero.  (Pretty obvious.)   11. Correction: 4 Bits: # of Bit Length codes - 4     (4 - 19)   12. Note: length code 284 can represent 227-258, but length code 285       really is 258.  The last length deserves its own, short code       since it gets used a lot in very redundant files.  The length       258 is special since 258 - 3 (the min match length) is 255.   13. The literal/length and distance code bit lengths are read as a       single stream of lengths.  It is possible (and advantageous) for       a repeat code (16, 17, or 18) to go across the boundary between       the two sets of lengths.  */

There are defaults for NEXTBYTE and FLUSH() below for use as     examples of what those functions need to do.

comment|/* Macros for inflate() bit peeking and grabbing.    The usage is:          NEEDBITS(glbl,j)         x = b& mask[j];         DUMPBITS(j)     where NEEDBITS makes sure that b has at least j bits in it, and    DUMPBITS removes the bits from b.  The macros use the variable k    for the number of bits in b.  Normally, b and k are register    variables for speed, and are initialized at the begining of a    routine that uses these macros from a global bit buffer and count.     In order to not ask for more bits than there are in the compressed    stream, the Huffman tables are constructed to only ask for just    enough bits to make up the end-of-block code (value 256).  Then no    bytes need to be "returned" to the buffer at the end of the last    block.  See the huft_build() routine.  */

comment|/*    Huffman code decoding is performed using a multi-level table lookup.    The fastest way to decode is to simply build a lookup table whose    size is determined by the longest code.  However, the time it takes    to build this table can also be a factor if the data being decoded    is not very long.  The most common codes are necessarily the    shortest codes, so those codes dominate the decoding time, and hence    the speed.  The idea is you can have a shorter table that decodes the    shorter, more probable codes, and then point to subsidiary tables for    the longer codes.  The time it costs to decode the longer codes is    then traded against the time it takes to make longer tables.     This results of this trade are in the variables lbits and dbits    below.  lbits is the number of bits the first level table for literal/    length codes can decode in one step, and dbits is the same thing for    the distance codes.  Subsequent tables are also less than or equal to    those sizes.  These values may be adjusted either when all of the    codes are shorter than that, in which case the longest code length in    bits is used, or when the shortest code is *longer* than the requested    table size, in which case the length of the shortest code in bits is    used.     There are two different values for the two tables, since they code a    different number of possibilities each.  The literal/length table    codes 286 possible values, or in a flat code, a little over eight    bits.  The distance table codes 30 possible values, or a little less    than five bits, flat.  The optimum values for speed end up being    about one bit more than those, so lbits is 8+1 and dbits is 5+1.    The optimum values may differ though from machine to machine, and    possibly even between compilers.  Your mileage may vary.  */
