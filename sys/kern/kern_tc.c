comment|/*  * Clock handling routines.  *  * This code is written to operate with two timers that run independently of  * each other.  The main clock, running hz times per second, is used to keep  * track of real time.  The second timer handles kernel and user profiling,  * and does resource use estimation.  If the second timer is programmable,  * it is randomized to avoid aliasing between the two clocks.  For example,  * the randomization prevents an adversary from always giving up the cpu  * just before its quantum expires.  Otherwise, it would never accumulate  * cpu ticks.  The mean frequency of the second timer is stathz.  *  * If no second timer exists, stathz will be zero; in this case we drive  * profiling and statistics off the main clock.  This WILL NOT be accurate;  * do not do it unless absolutely necessary.  *  * The statistics clock may (or may not) be run at a higher rate while  * profiling.  This profile clock runs at profhz.  We require that profhz  * be an integral multiple of stathz.  *  * If the statistics clock is running fast, it must be divided by the ratio  * profhz/stathz for statistics.  (For profiling, every tick counts.)  */

If the kernel PPS  * discipline code is configured (PPS_SYNC), the PPS signal itself  * determines the new time offset, instead of the calling argument.  * Presumably, calls to ntp_adjtime() occur only when the caller  * believes the local clock is valid within some bound (+-128 ms with  * NTP). If the caller's time is far different than the PPS time, an  * argument will ensue, and it's not clear who will lose.  *  * For uncompensated quartz crystal oscillatores and nominal update  * intervals less than 1024 s, operation should be in phase-lock mode  * (STA_FLL = 0), where the loop is disciplined to phase. For update  * intervals greater than thiss, operation should be in frequency-lock  * mode (STA_FLL = 1), where the loop is disciplined to frequency.  *  * Note: splclock() is in effect.  */

It measures the PPS phase  * and leaves it in a handy spot for the hardclock() routine. It  * integrates successive PPS phase differences and calculates the  * frequency offset. This is used in hardclock() to discipline the CPU  * clock oscillator so that intrinsic frequency error is cancelled out.  * The code requires the caller to capture the time and hardware counter  * value at the on-time PPS signal transition.  *  * Note that, on some Unix systems, this routine runs at an interrupt  * priority level higher than the timer interrupt routine hardclock().  * Therefore, the variables used are distinct from the hardclock()  * variables, except for certain exceptions: The PPS frequency pps_freq  * and phase pps_offset variables are determined by this routine and  * updated atomically. The time_tolerance variable can be considered a  * constant, since it is infrequently changed, and then only when the  * PPS signal is disabled. The watchdog counter pps_valid is updated  * once per second by hardclock() and is atomically cleared in this  * routine.  */
