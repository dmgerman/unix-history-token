Those in  * capital letters are in an mmapp()ed area shared with userspace,  * while others are private to the kernel.  * Shared structures do not contain pointers but only relative  * offsets, so that addressing is portable between kernel and userspace.  *  * The 'softc' of each interface is extended with a struct netmap_adapter  * containing information to support netmap operation. In addition to  * the fixed fields, it has two pointers to reach the arrays of  * 'struct netmap_kring' which in turn reaches the various  * struct netmap_ring, shared with userspace.    softc +----------------+ | standard fields| | if_pspare[0] ----------+ +----------------+       |                          | +----------------+<------+ |(netmap_adapter)| |                |                             netmap_kring | tx_rings *--------------------------------->+-------------+ |                |       netmap_kring         | ring *---------> ... | rx_rings *---------->+--------------+       | nr_hwcur    | +----------------+     | ring    *-------+    | nr_hwavail  |                        | nr_hwcur     |  |    | selinfo     |                        | nr_hwavail   |  |    +-------------+                        | selinfo      |  |    |     ...     |                        +--------------+  |  (na_num_rings+1 entries)                        |    ....      |  |    |             |                     (na_num_rings+1 entries)  +-------------+                        |              |  |                        +--------------+  |                                          |      NETMAP_RING                                          +---->+-------------+                                              / | cur         |    NETMAP_IF  (nifp, one per file desc.)    /  | avail       |     +---------------+                      /   | buf_ofs     |     | ni_num_queues |                     /    +=============+     |               |                    /     | buf_idx     | slot[0]     |               |                   /      | len, flags  |     |               |                  /       +-------------+     +===============+                 /        | buf_idx     | slot[1]     | txring_ofs[0] | (rel.to nifp)--'         | len, flags  |     | txring_ofs[1] |                          +-------------+   (num_rings+1 entries)                     (nr_num_slots entries)     | txring_ofs[n] |                          | buf_idx     | slot[n-1]     +---------------+                          | len, flags  |     | rxring_ofs[0] |                          +-------------+     | rxring_ofs[1] |   (num_rings+1 entries)     | txring_ofs[n] |     +---------------+   * The NETMAP_RING is the shadow ring that mirrors the NIC rings.  * Each slot has the index of a buffer, its length and some flags.  * In user space, the buffer address is computed as  *	(char *)ring + buf_ofs + index*MAX_BUF_SIZE  * In the kernel, buffers do not necessarily need to be contiguous,  * and the virtual and physical addresses are derived through  * a lookup table.

comment|/*  * Netmap representation of a TX or RX ring (also known as "queue").  * This is a queue implemented as a fixed-size circular array.  * At the software level, two fields are important: avail and cur.  *  * In TX rings:  *	avail	indicates the number of slots available for transmission.  *		It is decremented by the application when it appends a  *		packet, and set to nr_hwavail (see below) on a  *		NIOCTXSYNC to reflect the actual state of the queue  *		(keeping track of completed transmissions).  *	cur	indicates the empty slot to use for the next packet  *		to send (i.e. the "tail" of the queue).  *		It is incremented by the application.  *  *   The kernel side of netmap uses two additional fields in its own  *   private ring structure, netmap_kring:  *	nr_hwcur is a copy of nr_cur on an NIOCTXSYNC.  *	nr_hwavail is the number of slots known as available by the  *		hardware. It is updated on an INTR (inc by the  *		number of packets sent) and on a NIOCTXSYNC  *		(decrease by nr_cur - nr_hwcur)  *		A special case, nr_hwavail is -1 if the transmit  *		side is idle (no pending transmits).  *  * In RX rings:  *	avail	is the number of packets available (possibly 0).  *		It is decremented by the software when it consumes  *		a packet, and set to nr_hwavail on a NIOCRXSYNC  *	cur	indicates the first slot that contains a packet  *		(the "head" of the queue).  *		It is incremented by the software when it consumes  *		a packet.  *  *   The kernel side of netmap uses two additional fields in the kring:  *	nr_hwcur is a copy of nr_cur on an NIOCRXSYNC  *	nr_hwavail is the number of packets available. It is updated  *		on INTR (inc by the number of new packets arrived)  *		and on NIOCRXSYNC (decreased by nr_cur - nr_hwcur).  *  * DATA OWNERSHIP/LOCKING:  *	The netmap_ring is owned by the user program and it is only  *	accessed or modified in the upper half of the kernel during  *	a system call.  *  *	The netmap_kring is only modified by the upper half of the kernel.  */
