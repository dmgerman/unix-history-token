An extra 64-bit pointer  * is provided for user-supplied buffers in the tx path.  *  * In user space, the buffer address is computed as  *	(char *)ring + buf_ofs + index * NETMAP_BUF_SIZE  *  * Added in NETMAP_API 11:  *  * + NIOCREGIF can request the allocation of extra spare buffers from  *   the same memory pool. The desired number of buffers must be in  *   nr_arg3. The ioctl may return fewer buffers, depending on memory  *   availability. nr_arg3 will return the actual value, and, once  *   mapped, nifp->ni_bufs_head will be the index of the first buffer.  *  *   The buffers are linked to each other using the first uint32_t  *   as the index. On close, ni_bufs_head must point to the list of  *   buffers to be released.  *  * + NIOCREGIF can request space for extra rings (and buffers)  *   allocated in the same memory space. The number of extra rings  *   is in nr_arg1, and is advisory. This is a no-op on NICs where  *   the size of the memory space is fixed.  *  * + NIOCREGIF can attach to PIPE rings sharing the same memory  *   space with a parent device. The ifname indicates the parent device,  *   which must already exist. Flags in nr_flags indicate if we want to  *   bind the master or slave side, the index (from nr_ringid)  *   is just a cookie and does need to be sequential.  *  * + NIOCREGIF can also attach to 'monitor' rings that replicate  *   the content of specific rings, also from the same memory space.  *  *   Extra flags in nr_flags support the above functions.  *   Application libraries may use the following naming scheme:  *	netmap:foo			all NIC ring pairs  *	netmap:foo^			only host ring pair  *	netmap:foo+			all NIC ring + host ring pairs  *	netmap:foo-k			the k-th NIC ring pair  *	netmap:foo{k			PIPE ring pair k, master side  *	netmap:foo}k			PIPE ring pair k, slave side  */

NETMAP_NO_TX_POLL is unaffected.  *  *	NOTE: THE FOLLOWING (nr_flags == 0) IS DEPRECATED:  *	If nr_flags == 0, NETMAP_HW_RING and NETMAP_SW_RING control  *	the binding as follows:  *	0 (default)			binds all physical rings  *	NETMAP_HW_RING | ring number	binds a single ring pair  *	NETMAP_SW_RING			binds only the host tx/rx rings  *  *	NETMAP_NO_TX_POLL can be OR-ed to make select()/poll() push  *		packets on tx rings only if POLLOUT is set.  *		The default is to push any pending packet.  *  *	NETMAP_DO_RX_POLL can be OR-ed to make select()/poll() release  *		packets on rx rings also when POLLIN is NOT set.  *		The default is to touch the rx ring only with POLLIN.  *		Note that this is the opposite of TX because it  *		reflects the common usage.  *  *	NOTE: NETMAP_PRIV_MEM IS DEPRECATED, use nr_arg2 instead.  *	NETMAP_PRIV_MEM is set on return for ports that do not use  *		the global memory allocator.  *		This information is not significant and applications  *		should look at the region id in nr_arg2  *  * nr_flags	is the recommended mode to indicate which rings should  *		be bound to a file descriptor.
