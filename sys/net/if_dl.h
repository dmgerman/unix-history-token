comment|/*   * A Link-Level Sockaddr may specify the interface in one of two  * ways: either by means of a system-provided index number (computed  * anew and possibly differently on every reboot), or by a human-readable  * string such as "il0" (for managerial convenience).  *   * Census taking actions, such as something akin to SIOCGCONF would return  * both the index and the human name.  *   * High volume transactions (such as giving a link-level ``from'' address  * in a recvfrom or recvmsg call) may be likely only to provide the indexed  * form, (which requires fewer copy operations and less space).  *   * The form and interpretation  of the link-level address is purely a matter  * of convention between the device driver and its consumers; however, it is  * expected that all drivers for an interface of a given if_type will agree.  */
