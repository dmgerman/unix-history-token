comment|/* generic SCSI header file.  We use the same minor number format  * as on SGI except that the flag bits aren't available because they  * are used as the board index.  *  * The minor number format is:  *  FF UUU III (FFUU UIII)  *  * Where:  *  FF is the board index  * UUU are the LUN  * III is the SCSI ID (controller)  */
