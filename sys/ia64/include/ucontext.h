comment|/*  * The mc_flags field provides the necessary clues when dealing with the gory  * details of ia64 specific contexts. A comprehensive explanation is added for  * everybody's sanity, including the author's.  *  * The first and foremost variation in the context is synchronous contexts  * (= synctx) versus asynchronous contexts (= asynctx). A synctx is created  * synchronously WRT program execution and has the advantage that none of the  * scratch registers have to be saved. They are assumed to be clobbered by the  * call to the function that creates the context. An asynctx needs to have the  * scratch registers preserved because it can describe any point in a thread's  * (or process') execution.  *  * Below a description of the flags and their meaning:  *  *	_MC_FLAGS_ASYNC_CONTEXT  *		If set, indicates that mc_scratch and mc_scratch_fp are both  *		valid. IFF not set, _MC_FLAGS_RETURN_VALID indicates if the  *		return registers are valid or not.  *	_MC_FLAGS_HIGHFP_VALID  *		If set, indicates that the high FP registers (f32-f127) are  *		valid. This flag is very likely not going to be set for any  *		sensible synctx, but is not explicitly disallowed. Any synctx  *		that has this flag may or may not have the high FP registers  *		restored. In short: don't do it.  *	_MC_FLAGS_KSE_SET_MBOX  *		This flag is special to setcontext(2) and swapcontext(2). It  *		instructs the kernel to write the value in mc_special.isr to  *		the memory address pointed to by mc_special.ifa. This allows  *		the kernel to switch to a new context in a KSE based threaded  *		program. Note that this is a non-srandard extension to the  *		otherwise standard system calls and use of this flag should be  *		limited to KSE.  *	_MC_FLAGS_RETURN_VALID  *		If set and _MC_FLAGS_ASYNC_CONTEXT is not set indicates that  *		the ABI defined return registers are valid. Both getcontext(2)  *		and swapcontext(2) need to save the system call return values.  *		Any synctx that does not have this flag may still have the  *		return registers restored from the context.  *	_MC_FLAGS_SCRATCH_VALID  *		If set and _MC_FLAGS_ASYNC_CONTEXT is not set indicates that  *		the scratch registers, but not the FP registers are valid.  *		This flag is set in contexts passed to signal handlers. This  *		flag is a superset of _MC_FLAGS_RETURN_VALID. If both flags  *		are set, this flag takes precedence.  */
