comment|/*  * We do not yet implement any categories.  We use lattr_t's flags  * field to implement the "LOMAC_ATTR_LOWWRITE" exception.  When  * this bit is set on a file, lowest-level processes can write to  * the file, regardless of the file's level.  *  * There is also the LOMAC_ATTR_LOWNOOPEN flag, which prevents the  * opening of a given object to subjects with a lower level than its  * own.  *  * LOMAC_ATTR_NONETDEMOTE is set on subjects to prevent demotion on  * network reads; LOMAC_ATTR_NODEMOTE is set on subjects to prevent  * all demotion.  Both of these will effectively set a high-level  * subject as very trusted (and must be used sparingly).  */
