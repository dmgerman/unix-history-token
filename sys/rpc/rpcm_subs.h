comment|/*  * Now for the macros that do the simple stuff and call the functions  * for the hard stuff.  * These macros use several vars. declared in rpcm_reqhead and these  * vars. must not be used elsewhere unless you are careful not to corrupt  * them. The vars. starting with pN and tN (N=1,2,3,..) are temporaries  * that may be used so long as the value is not expected to retained  * after a macro.  * I know, this is kind of dorkey, but it makes the actual op functions  * fairly clean and deals with the mess caused by the xdr discriminating  * unions.  */
