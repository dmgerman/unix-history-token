comment|/*  * Tor's clock improvements.  *  *  When the giant kernel lock disappears, a different strategy should  *  probably be used, thus this patch can only be considered a temporary  *  measure.  *  *  This patch causes (NCPU-1)*(128+100) extra IPIs per second.  *  During profiling, the number is (NCPU-1)*(1024+100) extra IPIs/s  *  in addition to extra IPIs due to forwarding ASTs to other CPUs.  *  *  Having a shared AST flag in an SMP configuration is wrong, and I've  *  just kludged around it, based upon the kernel lock blocking other  *  processors from entering the kernel while handling an AST for one  *  processor. When the giant kernel lock disappers, this kludge breaks.  *  *  -- Tor  */

comment|/*  * FAST_WITHOUTCPL - now made the default (define removed).  Text below   * contains the current discussion.  I am confident we can find a solution  * that does not require us to process softints from a hard int, which can  * kill serial performance due to the lack of true hardware ipl's.  *  ****  *  * Ignore the ipending bits when exiting FAST_INTR() routines.  *  * according to Bruce:  *  * setsoft*() may set ipending.  setsofttty() is actually used in the  * FAST_INTR handler in some serial drivers.  This is necessary to get  * output completions and other urgent events handled as soon as possible.  * The flag(s) could be set in a variable other than ipending, but they  * needs to be checked against cpl to decide whether the software interrupt  * handler can/should run.  *  *  (FAST_INTR used to just return  * in all cases until rev.1.7 of vector.s.  This worked OK provided there  * were no user-mode CPU hogs.  CPU hogs caused an average latency of 1/2  * clock tick for output completions...)  ***  *  * So I need to restore cpl handling someday, but AFTER  *  I finish making spl/cpl MP-safe.  */
