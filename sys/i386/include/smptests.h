comment|/*  * Tor's clock improvements.  *  *  When the giant kernel lock disappears, a different strategy should  *  probably be used, thus this patch can only be considered a temporary  *  measure.  *  *  This patch causes (NCPU-1)*(128+100) extra IPIs per second.  *  During profiling, the number is (NCPU-1)*(1024+100) extra IPIs/s  *  in addition to extra IPIs due to forwarding ASTs to other CPUs.  *  *  Having a shared AST flag in an SMP configuration is wrong, and I've  *  just kludged around it, based upon the kernel lock blocking other  *  processors from entering the kernel while handling an AST for one  *  processor. When the giant kernel lock disappers, this kludge breaks.  *  *  -- Tor  */
