Stark (stark@cs.sunysb.edu)  * December 2, 1992  *  * NOTES:  *  * The TW523 is a carrier-current modem for home control/automation purposes.  * It is made by:  *  * 	X-10 Inc.  * 	185A LeGrand Ave.  * 	Northvale, NJ 07647  * 	USA  * 	(201) 784-9700 or 1-800-526-0027  *  * 	X-10 Home Controls Inc.  * 	1200 Aerowood Drive, Unit 20  * 	Mississauga, Ontario  *	(416) 624-4446 or 1-800-387-3346  *  * The TW523 is designed for communications using the X-10 protocol,  * which is compatible with a number of home control systems, including  * Radio Shack "Plug 'n Power(tm)" and Stanley "Lightmaker(tm)."  * I bought my TW523 from:  *  *	Home Control Concepts  *	9353-C Activity Road  *	San Diego, CA 92126  *	(619) 693-8887  *  * They supplied me with the TW523 (which has an RJ-11 four-wire modular  * telephone connector), a modular cable, an RJ-11 to DB-25 connector with  * internal wiring, documentation from X-10 on the TW523 (very good),  * an instruction manual by Home Control Concepts (not very informative),  * and a floppy disk containing binary object code of some demonstration/test  * programs and of a C function library suitable for controlling the TW523  * by an IBM PC under MS-DOS (not useful to me other than to verify that  * the unit worked).  I suggest saving money and buying the bare TW523  * rather than the TW523 development kit (what I bought), because if you  * are running FreeBSD you don't really care about the DOS binaries.  *  * The interface to the TW-523 consists of four wires on the RJ-11 connector,  * which are jumpered to somewhat more wires on the DB-25 connector, which  * in turn is intended to plug into the PC parallel printer port.  I dismantled  * the DB-25 connector to find out what they had done:  *  *	Signal		RJ-11 pin	DB-25 pin(s)	Parallel Port  *	Transmit TX	  4 (Y)		2, 4, 6, 8	Data out  *	Receive RX	  3 (G)		10, 14		-ACK, -AutoFeed  *	Common		  2 (R)		25		Common  *	Zero crossing	  1 (B)		17 or 12	-Select or +PaperEnd  *  * NOTE: In the original cable I have (which I am still using, May, 1997)  * the Zero crossing signal goes to pin 17 (-Select) on the parallel port.  * In retrospect, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense, given that the  * -Select signal propagates the other direction.  Indeed, some people have  * reported problems with this, and have had success using pin 12 (+PaperEnd)  * instead.  This driver searches for the zero crossing signal on either  * pin 17 or pin 12, so it should work with either cable configuration.  * My suggestion would be to start by making the cable so that the zero  * crossing signal goes to pin 12 on the parallel port.  *  * The zero crossing signal is used to synchronize transmission to the  * zero crossings of the AC line, as detailed in the X-10 documentation.  * It would be nice if one could generate interrupts with this signal,  * however one needs interrupts on both the rising and falling edges,  * and the -ACK signal to the parallel port interrupts only on the falling  * edge, so it can't be done without additional hardware.  *  * In this driver, the transmit function is performed in a non-interrupt-driven  * fashion, by polling the zero crossing signal to determine when a transition  * has occurred.  This wastes CPU time during transmission, but it seems like  * the best that can be done without additional hardware.  One problem with  * the scheme is that preemption of the CPU during transmission can cause loss  * of sync.  The driver tries to catch this, by noticing that a long delay  * loop has somehow become foreshortened, and the transmission is aborted with  * an error return.  It is up to the user level software to handle this  * situation (most likely by retrying the transmission).  */

comment|/*  * Transmission is done by calling write() to send three byte packets of data.  * The first byte contains a four bit house code (0=A to 15=P).  * The second byte contains five bit unit/key code (0=unit 1 to 15=unit 16,  * 16=All Units Off to 31 = Status Request).  The third byte specifies  * the number of times the packet is to be transmitted without any  * gaps between successive transmissions.  Normally this is 2, as per  * the X-10 documentation, but sometimes (e.g. for bright and dim codes)  * it can be another value.  Each call to write can specify an arbitrary  * number of data bytes.  An incomplete packet is buffered until a subsequent  * call to write() provides data to complete it.  At most one packet will  * actually be processed in any call to write().  Successive calls to write()  * leave a three-cycle gap between transmissions, per the X-10 documentation.  *  * Reception is done using read().  * The driver produces a series of three-character packets.  * In each packet, the first character consists of flags,  * the second character is a four bit house code (0-15),  * and the third character is a five bit key/function code (0-31).  * The flags are the following:  */

This assumes, of course, that the    * packet is well-formed.  We do the best we can at trying to    * catch errors by aborting if too much time has gone by, and    * by tossing out a packet if too many bits arrive, but the    * whole scheme is probably not as robust as if we had a nice    * interrupt on every half cycle of the power line.    * If we have high-resolution time-of-day routines, then we    * can do a bit more sanity checking.    */
