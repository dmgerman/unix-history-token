These may be different in the adapter 	cards (including sound cards) made by other vendors. 	It is unknown if the Creative interface is based on a reference design 	provided by Matsushita (other interface vendors would similar or 	identical if this was the case).  	The drive is actually capable of some things that the Creative 	interface doesn't implement, such as DMA and interrupts.  	See matcd.h for defines related to the Matsushita drive itself. */
