comment|/*  * Earlier versions of this interface definition declared the  * method_mask[] member as an array of __u32 but treated it as a  * bitmap made up of longs in the kernel.  This ambiguity meant that  * 32-bit big-endian applications that can run on both 32-bit and  * 64-bit kernels had no consistent ABI to rely on, and 64-bit  * big-endian applications that treated method_mask as being made up  * of 32-bit words would have their bitmap misinterpreted.  *  * To clear up this confusion, we change the declaration of  * method_mask[] to use unsigned long and handle the conversion from  * 32-bit userspace to 64-bit kernel for big-endian systems in the  * compat_ioctl method.  Unfortunately, to keep the structure layout  * the same, we need the method_mask[] array to be aligned only to 4  * bytes even when long is 64 bits, which forces us into this ugly  * typedef.  */
