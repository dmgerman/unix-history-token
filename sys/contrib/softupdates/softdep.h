comment|/*  * Allocation dependencies are handled with undo/redo on the in-memory  * copy of the data. A particular data dependency is eliminated when  * it is ALLCOMPLETE: that is ATTACHED, DEPCOMPLETE, and COMPLETE.  *   * ATTACHED means that the data is not currently being written to  * disk. UNDONE means that the data has been rolled back to a safe  * state for writing to the disk. When the I/O completes, the data is  * restored to its current form and the state reverts to ATTACHED.  * The data must be locked throughout the rollback, I/O, and roll  * forward so that the rolled back information is never visible to  * user processes. The COMPLETE flag indicates that the item has been  * written. For example, a dependency that requires that an inode be  * written will be marked COMPLETE after the inode has been written  * to disk. The DEPCOMPLETE flag indicates the completion of any other  * dependencies such as the writing of a cylinder group map has been  * completed. A dependency structure may be freed only when both it  * and its dependencies have completed and any rollbacks that are in  * progress have finished as indicated by the set of ALLCOMPLETE flags  * all being set. The two MKDIR flags indicate additional dependencies  * that must be done when creating a new directory. MKDIR_BODY is  * cleared when the directory data block containing the "." and ".."  * entries has been written. MKDIR_PARENT is cleared when the parent  * inode with the increased link count for ".." has been written. When  * both MKDIR flags have been cleared, the DEPCOMPLETE flag is set to  * indicate that the directory dependencies have been completed. The  * writing of the directory inode itself sets the COMPLETE flag which  * then allows the directory entry for the new directory to be written  * to disk. The RMDIR flag marks a dirrem structure as representing  * the removal of a directory rather than a file. When the removal  * dependencies are completed, additional work needs to be done  * (truncation of the "." and ".." entries, an additional decrement  * of the associated inode, and a decrement of the parent inode). The  * DIRCHG flag marks a diradd structure as representing the changing  * of an existing entry rather than the addition of a new one. When  * the update is complete the dirrem associated with the inode for  * the old name must be added to the worklist to do the necessary  * reference count decrement. The GOINGAWAY flag indicates that the  * data structure is frozen from further change until its dependencies  * have been completed and its resources freed after which it will be  * discarded. The IOSTARTED flag prevents multiple calls to the I/O  * start routine from doing multiple rollbacks. The ONWORKLIST flag  * shows whether the structure is currently linked onto a worklist.  */

comment|/*  * The "inodedep" structure tracks the set of dependencies associated  * with an inode. One task that it must manage is delayed operations  * (i.e., work requests that must be held until the inodedep's associated  * inode has been written to disk). Getting an inode from its incore   * state to the disk requires two steps to be taken by the filesystem  * in this order: first the inode must be copied to its disk buffer by  * the VOP_UPDATE operation; second the inode's buffer must be written  * to disk. To ensure that both operations have happened in the required  * order, the inodedep maintains two lists. Delayed operations are  * placed on the id_inowait list. When the VOP_UPDATE is done, all  * operations on the id_inowait list are moved to the id_bufwait list.  * When the buffer is written, the items on the id_bufwait list can be  * safely moved to the work queue to be processed. A second task of the  * inodedep structure is to track the status of block allocation within  * the inode.  Each block that is allocated is represented by an  * "allocdirect" structure (see below). It is linked onto the id_newinoupdt  * list until both its contents and its allocation in the cylinder  * group map have been written to disk. Once these dependencies have been  * satisfied, it is removed from the id_newinoupdt list and any followup  * actions such as releasing the previous block or fragment are placed  * on the id_inowait list. When an inode is updated (a VOP_UPDATE is  * done), the "inodedep" structure is linked onto the buffer through  * its worklist. Thus, it will be notified when the buffer is about  * to be written and when it is done. At the update time, all the  * elements on the id_newinoupdt list are moved to the id_inoupdt list  * since those changes are now relevant to the copy of the inode in the  * buffer. Also at update time, the tasks on the id_inowait list are  * moved to the id_bufwait list so that they will be executed when  * the updated inode has been written to disk. When the buffer containing  * the inode is written to disk, any updates listed on the id_inoupdt  * list are rolled back as they are not yet safe. Following the write,  * the changes are once again rolled forward and any actions on the  * id_bufwait list are processed (since those actions are now safe).  * The entries on the id_inoupdt and id_newinoupdt lists must be kept  * sorted by logical block number to speed the calculation of the size  * of the rolled back inode (see explanation in initiate_write_inodeblock).  * When a directory entry is created, it is represented by a diradd.  * The diradd is added to the id_inowait list as it cannot be safely  * written to disk until the inode that it represents is on disk. After  * the inode is written, the id_bufwait list is processed and the diradd  * entries are moved to the id_pendinghd list where they remain until  * the directory block containing the name has been written to disk.  * The purpose of keeping the entries on the id_pendinghd list is so that  * the softdep_fsync function can find and push the inode's directory  * name(s) as part of the fsync operation for that file.  */

comment|/*  * A "diradd" structure is linked to an "inodedep" id_inowait list when a  * new directory entry is allocated that references the inode described  * by "inodedep". When the inode itself is written (either the initial  * allocation for new inodes or with the increased link count for  * existing inodes), the COMPLETE flag is set in da_state. If the entry  * is for a newly allocated inode, the "inodedep" structure is associated  * with a bmsafemap which prevents the inode from being written to disk  * until the cylinder group has been updated. Thus the da_state COMPLETE  * flag cannot be set until the inode bitmap dependency has been removed.  * When creating a new file, it is safe to write the directory entry that  * claims the inode once the referenced inode has been written. Since  * writing the inode clears the bitmap dependencies, the DEPCOMPLETE flag  * in the diradd can be set unconditionally when creating a file. When  * creating a directory, there are two additional dependencies described by  * mkdir structures (see their description below). When these dependencies  * are resolved the DEPCOMPLETE flag is set in the diradd structure.  * If there are multiple links created to the same inode, there will be  * a separate diradd structure created for each link. The diradd is  * linked onto the pg_diraddhd list of the pagedep for the directory  * page that contains the entry. When a directory page is written,  * the pg_diraddhd list is traversed to rollback any entries that are  * not yet ready to be written to disk. If a directory entry is being  * changed (by rename) rather than added, the DIRCHG flag is set and  * the da_previous entry points to the entry that will be "removed"  * once the new entry has been committed. During rollback, entries  * with da_previous are replaced with the previous inode number rather  * than zero.  *  * The overlaying of da_pagedep and da_previous is done to keep the  * structure down to 32 bytes in size on a 32-bit machine. If a  * da_previous entry is present, the pointer to its pagedep is available  * in the associated dirrem entry. If the DIRCHG flag is set, the  * da_previous entry is valid; if not set the da_pagedep entry is valid.  * The DIRCHG flag never changes; it is set when the structure is created  * if appropriate and is never cleared.  */

comment|/*  * Two "mkdir" structures are needed to track the additional dependencies  * associated with creating a new directory entry. Normally a directory  * addition can be committed as soon as the newly referenced inode has been  * written to disk with its increased link count. When a directory is  * created there are two additional dependencies: writing the directory  * data block containing the "." and ".." entries (MKDIR_BODY) and writing  * the parent inode with the increased link count for ".." (MKDIR_PARENT).  * These additional dependencies are tracked by two mkdir structures that  * reference the associated "diradd" structure. When they have completed,  * they set the DEPCOMPLETE flag on the diradd so that it knows that its  * extra dependencies have been completed. The md_state field is used only  * to identify which type of dependency the mkdir structure is tracking.  * It is not used in the mainline code for any purpose other than consistency  * checking. All the mkdir structures in the system are linked together on  * a list. This list is needed so that a diradd can find its associated  * mkdir structures and deallocate them if it is prematurely freed (as for  * example if a mkdir is immediately followed by a rmdir of the same directory).  * Here, the free of the diradd must traverse the list to find the associated  * mkdir structures that reference it. The deletion would be faster if the  * diradd structure were simply augmented to have two pointers that referenced  * the associated mkdir's. However, this would increase the size of the diradd  * structure from 32 to 64-bits to speed a very infrequent operation.  */
