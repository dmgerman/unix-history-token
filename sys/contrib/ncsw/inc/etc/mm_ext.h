The Alignment argument tells from which                 free list allocate a block of memory. 2^alignment indicates                 the alignment that the base address of the allocated block                 should have.

The minimum baser address forces the location of the block                 to be from a given address onward.                 The routine passes through the specific free list of free                 blocks and seeks for the first base address equal or smaller                 than the required minimum address and end address larger than                 than the required base + its size - i.e. that may contain                 the required block.
