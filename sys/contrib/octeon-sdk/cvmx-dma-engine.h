The address that is the start of the buffer being freed is:                                                     - Buffer start address = ((ptr>> 7) - Back)<< 7.

Back must be 0x0, and buffers are never freed, for INBOUND, INTERNAL-ONLY,                                                 and EXTERNAL-ONLY PCI DMA transfers. */
