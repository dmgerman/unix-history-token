comment|/*  *  The Cyclic Subsystem  *  --------------------  *  *  Prehistory  *  *  Historically, most computer architectures have specified interval-based  *  timer parts (e.g. SPARCstation's counter/timer; Intel's i8254).  While  *  these parts deal in relative (i.e. not absolute) time values, they are  *  typically used by the operating system to implement the abstraction of  *  absolute time.  As a result, these parts cannot typically be reprogrammed  *  without introducing error in the system's notion of time.  *  *  Starting in about 1994, chip architectures began specifying high resolution  *  timestamp registers.  As of this writing (1999), all major chip families  *  (UltraSPARC, PentiumPro, MIPS, PowerPC, Alpha) have high resolution  *  timestamp registers, and two (UltraSPARC and MIPS) have added the capacity  *  to interrupt based on timestamp values.  These timestamp-compare registers  *  present a time-based interrupt source which can be reprogrammed arbitrarily  *  often without introducing error.  Given the low cost of implementing such a  *  timestamp-compare register (and the tangible benefit of eliminating  *  discrete timer parts), it is reasonable to expect that future chip  *  architectures will adopt this feature.  *  *  The cyclic subsystem has been designed to take advantage of chip  *  architectures with the capacity to interrupt based on absolute, high  *  resolution values of time.  *  *  Subsystem Overview  *  *  The cyclic subsystem is a low-level kernel subsystem designed to provide  *  arbitrarily high resolution, per-CPU interval timers (to avoid colliding  *  with existing terms, we dub such an interval timer a "cyclic").  *  Alternatively, a cyclic may be specified to be "omnipresent", denoting  *  firing on all online CPUs.  *  *  Cyclic Subsystem Interface Overview  *  -----------------------------------  *  *  The cyclic subsystem has interfaces with the kernel at-large, with other  *  kernel subsystems (e.g. the processor management subsystem, the checkpoint  *  resume subsystem) and with the platform (the cyclic backend).  Each  *  of these interfaces is given a brief synopsis here, and is described  *  in full above the interface's implementation.  *  *  The following diagram displays the cyclic subsystem's interfaces to  *  other kernel components.  The arrows denote a "calls" relationship, with  *  the large arrow indicating the cyclic subsystem's consumer interface.  *  Each arrow is labeled with the section in which the corresponding  *  interface is described.  *  *           Kernel at-large consumers  *           -----------++------------  *                      ||  *                      ||  *                     _||_  *                     \  /  *                      \/  *            +---------------------+  *            |                     |  *            |  Cyclic subsystem   |<-----------  Other kernel subsystems  *            |                     |  *            +---------------------+  *                   ^       |  *                   |       |  *                   |       |  *                   |       v  *            +---------------------+  *            |                     |  *            |   Cyclic backend    |  *            | (platform specific) |  *            |                     |  *            +---------------------+  *  *  *  Kernel At-Large Interfaces  *  *      cyclic_add()<-- Creates a cyclic  *      cyclic_add_omni()<-- Creates an omnipresent cyclic  *      cyclic_remove()<-- Removes a cyclic  *  *  Backend Interfaces  *  *      cyclic_init()<-- Initializes the cyclic subsystem  *      cyclic_fire()<-- Interrupt entry point  *  *  The backend-supplied interfaces (through the cyc_backend structure) are  *  documented in detail in<sys/cyclic_impl.h>  *  *  *  Cyclic Subsystem Implementation Overview  *  ----------------------------------------  *  *  The cyclic subsystem is designed to minimize interference between cyclics  *  on different CPUs.  Thus, all of the cyclic subsystem's data structures  *  hang off of a per-CPU structure, cyc_cpu.  *  *  Each cyc_cpu has a power-of-two sized array of cyclic structures (the  *  cyp_cyclics member of the cyc_cpu structure).  If cyclic_add() is called  *  and there does not exist a free slot in the cyp_cyclics array, the size of  *  the array will be doubled.  The array will never shrink.  Cyclics are  *  referred to by their index in the cyp_cyclics array, which is of type  *  cyc_index_t.  *  *  The cyclics are kept sorted by expiration time in the cyc_cpu's heap.  The  *  heap is keyed by cyclic expiration time, with parents expiring earlier  *  than their children.  *  *  Heap Management  *  *  The heap is managed primarily by cyclic_fire().  Upon entry, cyclic_fire()  *  compares the root cyclic's expiration time to the current time.  If the  *  expiration time is in the past, cyclic_expire() is called on the root  *  cyclic.  Upon return from cyclic_expire(), the cyclic's new expiration time  *  is derived by adding its interval to its old expiration time, and a  *  downheap operation is performed.  After the downheap, cyclic_fire()  *  examines the (potentially changed) root cyclic, repeating the  *  cyclic_expire()/add interval/cyclic_downheap() sequence until the root  *  cyclic has an expiration time in the future.  This expiration time  *  (guaranteed to be the earliest in the heap) is then communicated to the  *  backend via cyb_reprogram.  Optimal backends will next call cyclic_fire()  *  shortly after the root cyclic's expiration time.  *  *  To allow efficient, deterministic downheap operations, we implement the  *  heap as an array (the cyp_heap member of the cyc_cpu structure), with each  *  element containing an index into the CPU's cyp_cyclics array.  *  *  The heap is laid out in the array according to the following:  *  *   1.  The root of the heap is always in the 0th element of the heap array  *   2.  The left and right children of the nth element are element  *       (((n + 1)<< 1) - 1) and element ((n + 1)<< 1), respectively.  *  *  This layout is standard (see, e.g., Cormen's "Algorithms"); the proof  *  that these constraints correctly lay out a heap (or indeed, any binary  *  tree) is trivial and left to the reader.  *  *  To see the heap by example, assume our cyclics array has the following  *  members (at time t):  *  *            cy_handler                          cy_expire  *            ---------------------------------------------  *     [ 0]   clock()                            t+10000000  *     [ 1]   deadman()                        t+1000000000  *     [ 2]   clock_highres_fire()                    t+100  *     [ 3]   clock_highres_fire()                   t+1000  *     [ 4]   clock_highres_fire()                    t+500  *     [ 5]   (free)                                     --  *     [ 6]   (free)                                     --  *     [ 7]   (free)                                     --  *  *  The heap array could be:  *  *                [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]  *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  *              |  2  |  3  |  4  |  0  |  1  |  x  |  x  |  x  |  *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  *  *  Graphically, this array corresponds to the following (excuse the ASCII art):  *  *                                       2  *                                       |  *                    +------------------+------------------+  *                    3                                     4  *                    |  *          +---------+--------+  *          0                  1  *  *  Note that the heap is laid out by layer:  all nodes at a given depth are  *  stored in consecutive elements of the array.  Moreover, layers of  *  consecutive depths are in adjacent element ranges.  This property  *  guarantees high locality of reference during downheap operations.  *  Specifically, we are guaranteed that we can downheap to a depth of  *  *      lg (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t))  *  *  nodes with at most one cache miss.  On UltraSPARC (64 byte e-cache line  *  size), this corresponds to a depth of four nodes.  Thus, if there are  *  fewer than sixteen cyclics in the heap, downheaps on UltraSPARC miss at  *  most once in the e-cache.  *  *  Downheaps are required to compare siblings as they proceed down the  *  heap.  For downheaps proceeding beyond the one-cache-miss depth, every  *  access to a left child could potentially miss in the cache.  However,  *  if we assume  *  *      (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t))> 2,  *  *  then all siblings are guaranteed to be on the same cache line.  Thus, the  *  miss on the left child will guarantee a hit on the right child; downheaps  *  will incur at most one cache miss per layer beyond the one-cache-miss  *  depth.  The total number of cache misses for heap management during a  *  downheap operation is thus bounded by  *  *      lg (n) - lg (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t))  *  *  Traditional pointer-based heaps are implemented without regard to  *  locality.  Downheaps can thus incur two cache misses per layer (one for  *  each child), but at most one cache miss at the root.  This yields a bound  *  of  *  *      2 * lg (n) - 1  *  *  on the total cache misses.  *  *  This difference may seem theoretically trivial (the difference is, after  *  all, constant), but can become substantial in practice -- especially for  *  caches with very large cache lines and high miss penalties (e.g. TLBs).  *  *  Heaps must always be full, balanced trees.  Heap management must therefore  *  track the next point-of-insertion into the heap.  In pointer-based heaps,  *  recomputing this point takes O(lg (n)).  Given the layout of the  *  array-based implementation, however, the next point-of-insertion is  *  always:  *  *      heap[number_of_elements]  *  *  We exploit this property by implementing the free-list in the usused  *  heap elements.  Heap insertion, therefore, consists only of filling in  *  the cyclic at cyp_cyclics[cyp_heap[number_of_elements]], incrementing  *  the number of elements, and performing an upheap.  Heap deletion consists  *  of decrementing the number of elements, swapping the to-be-deleted element  *  with the element at cyp_heap[number_of_elements], and downheaping.  *  *  Filling in more details in our earlier example:  *  *                                               +--- free list head  *                                               |  *                                               V  *  *                [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]  *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  *              |  2  |  3  |  4  |  0  |  1  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  *  *  To insert into this heap, we would just need to fill in the cyclic at  *  cyp_cyclics[5], bump the number of elements (from 5 to 6) and perform  *  an upheap.  *  *  If we wanted to remove, say, cyp_cyclics[3], we would first scan for it  *  in the cyp_heap, and discover it at cyp_heap[1].  We would then decrement  *  the number of elements (from 5 to 4), swap cyp_heap[1] with cyp_heap[4],  *  and perform a downheap from cyp_heap[1].  The linear scan is required  *  because the cyclic does not keep a backpointer into the heap.  This makes  *  heap manipulation (e.g. downheaps) faster at the expense of removal  *  operations.  *  *  Expiry processing  *  *  As alluded to above, cyclic_expire() is called by cyclic_fire() to expire  *  a cyclic.  Cyclic subsystem consumers are guaranteed that for an arbitrary  *  time t in the future, their cyclic handler will have been called  *  (t - cyt_when) / cyt_interval times. cyclic_expire() simply needs to call  *  the handler.  *  *  Resizing  *  *  All of the discussion thus far has assumed a static number of cyclics.  *  Obviously, static limitations are not practical; we need the capacity  *  to resize our data structures dynamically.  *  *  We resize our data structures lazily, and only on a per-CPU basis.  *  The size of the data structures always doubles and never shrinks.  We  *  serialize adds (and thus resizes) on cpu_lock; we never need to deal  *  with concurrent resizes.  Resizes should be rare; they may induce jitter  *  on the CPU being resized, but should not affect cyclic operation on other  *  CPUs.  *  *  Three key cyc_cpu data structures need to be resized:  the cyclics array,  *  nad the heap array.  Resizing is relatively straightforward:  *  *    1.  The new, larger arrays are allocated in cyclic_expand() (called  *        from cyclic_add()).  *    2.  The contents of the old arrays are copied into the new arrays.  *    3.  The old cyclics array is bzero()'d  *    4.  The pointers are updated.  *  *  Removals  *  *  Cyclic removals should be rare.  To simplify the implementation (and to  *  allow optimization for the cyclic_fire()/cyclic_expire()  *  path), we force removals and adds to serialize on cpu_lock.  *  */

Optimal  *    backends will call into cyclic_fire() at or shortly after the time  *    requested via cyb_reprogram().  However, calling cyclic_fire()  *    arbitrarily late will only manifest latency bubbles; the correctness  *    of the cyclic subsystem does not rely on the timeliness of the backend.  *  *    cyclic_fire() is wait-free; it will not block or spin.  *  *  Return values  *  *    None.  *  */

If cyt_when  *    is set to 0, the cyclic will start to fire when cyt_interval next  *    divides the number of nanoseconds since boot.  *  *    The cyt_interval field _must_ be filled in by the caller; one-shots are  *    _not_ explicitly supported by the cyclic subsystem (cyclic_add() will  *    assert that cyt_interval is non-zero).  The maximum value for either  *    field is INT64_MAX; the caller is responsible for assuring that  *    cyt_when + cyt_interval<= INT64_MAX.  Neither field may be negative.  *  *    For an arbitrary time t in the future, the cyclic handler is guaranteed  *    to have been called (t - cyt_when) / cyt_interval times.  This will  *    be true even if interrupts have been disabled for periods greater than  *    cyt_interval nanoseconds.  In order to compensate for such periods,  *    the cyclic handler may be called a finite number of times with an  *    arbitrarily small interval.  *  *    The cyclic subsystem will not enforce any lower bound on the interval;  *    if the interval is less than the time required to process an interrupt,  *    the CPU will wedge.  It's the responsibility of the caller to assure that  *    either the value of the interval is sane, or that its caller has  *    sufficient privilege to deny service (i.e. its caller is root).  *  *  Return value  *  *    cyclic_add() returns a cyclic_id_t, which is guaranteed to be a value  *    other than CYCLIC_NONE.  cyclic_add() cannot fail.  *  *  Caller's context  *  *    cpu_lock must be held by the caller, and the caller must not be in  *    interrupt context.  cyclic_add() will perform a KM_SLEEP kernel  *    memory allocation, so the usual rules (e.g. p_lock cannot be held)  *    apply.  A cyclic may be added even in the presence of CPUs that have  *    not been configured with respect to the cyclic subsystem, but only  *    configured CPUs will be eligible to run the new cyclic.  *  *  Cyclic handler's context  *  *    Cyclic handlers will be executed in the interrupt context corresponding  *    to the specified level (i.e. either high, lock or low level).  The  *    usual context rules apply.  *  *    A cyclic handler may not grab ANY locks held by the caller of any of  *    cyclic_add() or cyclic_remove(); the implementation of these functions  *    may require blocking on cyclic handler completion.  *    Moreover, cyclic handlers may not make any call back into the cyclic  *    subsystem.  */

comment|/*  *  cyclic_id_t cyclic_add_omni(cyc_omni_handler_t *)  *  *  Overview  *  *    cyclic_add_omni() will create an omnipresent cyclic with the specified  *    online and offline handlers.  Omnipresent cyclics run on all online  *    CPUs, including CPUs which have unbound interrupts disabled.  *  *  Arguments  *  *    As its only argument, cyclic_add_omni() takes a cyc_omni_handler, which  *    has the following members:  *  *      void (*cyo_online)()<-- Online handler  *      void (*cyo_offline)()<-- Offline handler  *      void *cyo_arg<-- Argument to be passed to on/offline handlers  *  *  Online handler  *  *    The cyo_online member is a pointer to a function which has the following  *    four arguments:  *  *      void *<-- Argument (cyo_arg)  *      cpu_t *<-- Pointer to CPU about to be onlined  *      cyc_handler_t *<-- Pointer to cyc_handler_t; must be filled in  *                                 by omni online handler  *      cyc_time_t *<-- Pointer to cyc_time_t; must be filled in by  *                                 omni online handler  *  *    The omni cyclic online handler is always called _before_ the omni  *    cyclic begins to fire on the specified CPU.  As the above argument  *    description implies, the online handler must fill in the two structures  *    passed to it:  the cyc_handler_t and the cyc_time_t.  These are the  *    same two structures passed to cyclic_add(), outlined above.  This  *    allows the omni cyclic to have maximum flexibility; different CPUs may  *    optionally  *  *      (a)  have different intervals  *      (b)  be explicitly in or out of phase with one another  *      (c)  have different handlers  *      (d)  have different handler arguments  *      (e)  fire at different levels  *  *    Of these, (e) seems somewhat dubious, but is nonetheless allowed.  *  *    The omni online handler is called in the same context as cyclic_add(),  *    and has the same liberties:  omni online handlers may perform KM_SLEEP  *    kernel memory allocations, and may grab locks which are also acquired  *    by cyclic handlers.  However, omni cyclic online handlers may _not_  *    call back into the cyclic subsystem, and should be generally careful  *    about calling into arbitrary kernel subsystems.  *  *  Offline handler  *  *    The cyo_offline member is a pointer to a function which has the following  *    three arguments:  *  *      void *<-- Argument (cyo_arg)  *      cpu_t *<-- Pointer to CPU about to be offlined  *      void *<-- CPU's cyclic argument (that is, value  *                                 to which cyh_arg member of the cyc_handler_t  *                                 was set in the omni online handler)  *  *    The omni cyclic offline handler is always called _after_ the omni  *    cyclic has ceased firing on the specified CPU.  Its purpose is to  *    allow cleanup of any resources dynamically allocated in the omni cyclic  *    online handler.  The context of the offline handler is identical to  *    that of the online handler; the same constraints and liberties apply.  *  *    The offline handler is optional; it may be NULL.  *  *  Return value  *  *    cyclic_add_omni() returns a cyclic_id_t, which is guaranteed to be a  *    value other than CYCLIC_NONE.  cyclic_add_omni() cannot fail.  *  *  Caller's context  *  *    The caller's context is identical to that of cyclic_add(), specified  *    above.  */

comment|/*  *  void cyclic_remove(cyclic_id_t)  *  *  Overview  *  *    cyclic_remove() will remove the specified cyclic from the system.  *  *  Arguments and notes  *  *    The only argument is a cyclic_id returned from either cyclic_add() or  *    cyclic_add_omni().  *  *    By the time cyclic_remove() returns, the caller is guaranteed that the  *    removed cyclic handler has completed execution (this is the same  *    semantic that untimeout() provides).  As a result, cyclic_remove() may  *    need to block, waiting for the removed cyclic to complete execution.  *    This leads to an important constraint on the caller:  no lock may be  *    held across cyclic_remove() that also may be acquired by a cyclic  *    handler.  *  *  Return value  *  *    None; cyclic_remove() always succeeds.  *  *  Caller's context  *  *    cpu_lock must be held by the caller, and the caller must not be in  *    interrupt context.  The caller may not hold any locks which are also  *    grabbed by any cyclic handler.  See "Arguments and notes", above.  */
