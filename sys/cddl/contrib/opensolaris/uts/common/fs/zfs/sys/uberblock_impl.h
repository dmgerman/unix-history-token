comment|/*  * The uberblock version is incremented whenever an incompatible on-disk  * format change is made to the SPA, DMU, or ZAP.  *  * Note: the first two fields should never be moved.  When a storage pool  * is opened, the uberblock must be read off the disk before the version  * can be checked.  If the ub_version field is moved, we may not detect  * version mismatch.  If the ub_magic field is moved, applications that  * expect the magic number in the first word won't work.  */
