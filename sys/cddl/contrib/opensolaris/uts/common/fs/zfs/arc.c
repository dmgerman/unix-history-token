comment|/*  * DVA-based Adjustable Replacement Cache  *  * While much of the theory of operation used here is  * based on the self-tuning, low overhead replacement cache  * presented by Megiddo and Modha at FAST 2003, there are some  * significant differences:  *  * 1. The Megiddo and Modha model assumes any page is evictable.  * Pages in its cache cannot be "locked" into memory.  This makes  * the eviction algorithm simple: evict the last page in the list.  * This also make the performance characteristics easy to reason  * about.  Our cache is not so simple.  At any given moment, some  * subset of the blocks in the cache are un-evictable because we  * have handed out a reference to them.  Blocks are only evictable  * when there are no external references active.  This makes  * eviction far more problematic:  we choose to evict the evictable  * blocks that are the "lowest" in the list.  *  * There are times when it is not possible to evict the requested  * space.  In these circumstances we are unable to adjust the cache  * size.  To prevent the cache growing unbounded at these times we  * implement a "cache throttle" that slows the flow of new data  * into the cache until we can make space available.  *  * 2. The Megiddo and Modha model assumes a fixed cache size.  * Pages are evicted when the cache is full and there is a cache  * miss.  Our model has a variable sized cache.  It grows with  * high use, but also tries to react to memory pressure from the  * operating system: decreasing its size when system memory is  * tight.  *  * 3. The Megiddo and Modha model assumes a fixed page size. All  * elements of the cache are therefore exactly the same size.  So  * when adjusting the cache size following a cache miss, its simply  * a matter of choosing a single page to evict.  In our model, we  * have variable sized cache blocks (rangeing from 512 bytes to  * 128K bytes).  We therefore choose a set of blocks to evict to make  * space for a cache miss that approximates as closely as possible  * the space used by the new block.  *  * See also:  "ARC: A Self-Tuning, Low Overhead Replacement Cache"  * by N. Megiddo& D. Modha, FAST 2003  */

comment|/*  * The locking model:  *  * A new reference to a cache buffer can be obtained in two  * ways: 1) via a hash table lookup using the DVA as a key,  * or 2) via one of the ARC lists.  The arc_read() interface  * uses method 1, while the internal arc algorithms for  * adjusting the cache use method 2.  We therefore provide two  * types of locks: 1) the hash table lock array, and 2) the  * arc list locks.  *  * Buffers do not have their own mutexs, rather they rely on the  * hash table mutexs for the bulk of their protection (i.e. most  * fields in the arc_buf_hdr_t are protected by these mutexs).  *  * buf_hash_find() returns the appropriate mutex (held) when it  * locates the requested buffer in the hash table.  It returns  * NULL for the mutex if the buffer was not in the table.  *  * buf_hash_remove() expects the appropriate hash mutex to be  * already held before it is invoked.  *  * Each arc state also has a mutex which is used to protect the  * buffer list associated with the state.  When attempting to  * obtain a hash table lock while holding an arc list lock you  * must use: mutex_tryenter() to avoid deadlock.  Also note that  * the active state mutex must be held before the ghost state mutex.  *  * Arc buffers may have an associated eviction callback function.  * This function will be invoked prior to removing the buffer (e.g.  * in arc_do_user_evicts()).  Note however that the data associated  * with the buffer may be evicted prior to the callback.  The callback  * must be made with *no locks held* (to prevent deadlock).  Additionally,  * the users of callbacks must ensure that their private data is  * protected from simultaneous callbacks from arc_clear_callback()  * and arc_do_user_evicts().  *  * Note that the majority of the performance stats are manipulated  * with atomic operations.  *  * The L2ARC uses the l2arc_buflist_mtx global mutex for the following:  *  *	- L2ARC buflist creation  *	- L2ARC buflist eviction  *	- L2ARC write completion, which walks L2ARC buflists  *	- ARC header destruction, as it removes from L2ARC buflists  *	- ARC header release, as it removes from L2ARC buflists  */

These are  * the only buffers that can be evicted or deleted.  Within each  * state there are multiple lists, one for meta-data and one for  * non-meta-data.  Meta-data (indirect blocks, blocks of dnodes,  * etc.) is tracked separately so that it can be managed more  * explicitly: favored over data, limited explicitly.  *  * Anonymous buffers are buffers that are not associated with  * a DVA.  These are buffers that hold dirty block copies  * before they are written to stable storage.  By definition,  * they are "ref'd" and are considered part of arc_mru  * that cannot be freed.  Generally, they will aquire a DVA  * as they are written and migrate onto the arc_mru list.  *  * The ARC_l2c_only state is for buffers that are in the second  * level ARC but no longer in any of the ARC_m* lists.  The second  * level ARC itself may also contain buffers that are in any of  * the ARC_m* states - meaning that a buffer can exist in two  * places.  The reason for the ARC_l2c_only state is to keep the  * buffer header in the hash table, so that reads that hit the  * second level ARC benefit from these fast lookups.  */

Note that the `zio' parameter  * in the callback will be NULL in this case, since no IO was  * required.  If the block is not in the cache pass the read request  * on to the spa with a substitute callback function, so that the  * requested block will be added to the cache.  *  * If a read request arrives for a block that has a read in-progress,  * either wait for the in-progress read to complete (and return the  * results); or, if this is a read with a "done" func, add a record  * to the read to invoke the "done" func when the read completes,  * and return; or just return.  *  * arc_read_done() will invoke all the requested "done" functions  * for readers of this block.  */

The main role of this cache is to boost  * the performance of random read workloads.  The intended L2ARC devices  * include short-stroked disks, solid state disks, and other media with  * substantially faster read latency than disk.  *  *                 +-----------------------+  *                 |         ARC           |  *                 +-----------------------+  *                    |         ^     ^  *                    |         |     |  *      l2arc_feed_thread()    arc_read()  *                    |         |     |  *                    |  l2arc read   |  *                    V         |     |  *               +---------------+    |  *               |     L2ARC     |    |  *               +---------------+    |  *                   |    ^           |  *          l2arc_write() |           |  *                   |    |           |  *                   V    |           |  *                 +-------+      +-------+  *                 | vdev  |      | vdev  |  *                 | cache |      | cache |  *                 +-------+      +-------+  *                 +=========+     .-----.  *                 :  L2ARC  :    |-_____-|  *                 : devices :    | Disks |  *                 +=========+    `-_____-'  *  * Read requests are satisfied from the following sources, in order:  *  *	1) ARC  *	2) vdev cache of L2ARC devices  *	3) L2ARC devices  *	4) vdev cache of disks  *	5) disks  *  * Some L2ARC device types exhibit extremely slow write performance.  * To accommodate for this there are some significant differences between  * the L2ARC and traditional cache design:  *  * 1. There is no eviction path from the ARC to the L2ARC.  Evictions from  * the ARC behave as usual, freeing buffers and placing headers on ghost  * lists.  The ARC does not send buffers to the L2ARC during eviction as  * this would add inflated write latencies for all ARC memory pressure.  *  * 2. The L2ARC attempts to cache data from the ARC before it is evicted.  * It does this by periodically scanning buffers from the eviction-end of  * the MFU and MRU ARC lists, copying them to the L2ARC devices if they are  * not already there. It scans until a headroom of buffers is satisfied,  * which itself is a buffer for ARC eviction. If a compressible buffer is  * found during scanning and selected for writing to an L2ARC device, we  * temporarily boost scanning headroom during the next scan cycle to make  * sure we adapt to compression effects (which might significantly reduce  * the data volume we write to L2ARC). The thread that does this is  * l2arc_feed_thread(), illustrated below; example sizes are included to  * provide a better sense of ratio than this diagram:  *  *	       head -->                        tail  *	        +---------------------+----------+  *	ARC_mfu |:::::#:::::::::::::::|o#o###o###|-->.   # already on L2ARC  *	        +---------------------+----------+   |   o L2ARC eligible  *	ARC_mru |:#:::::::::::::::::::|#o#ooo####|-->|   : ARC buffer  *	        +---------------------+----------+   |  *	             15.9 Gbytes      ^ 32 Mbytes    |  *	                           headroom          |  *	                                      l2arc_feed_thread()  *	                                             |  *	                 l2arc write hand<--[oooo]--'  *	                         |           8 Mbyte  *	                         |          write max  *	                         V  *		  +==============================+  *	L2ARC dev |####|#|###|###|    |####| ... |  *	          +==============================+  *	                     32 Gbytes  *  * 3. If an ARC buffer is copied to the L2ARC but then hit instead of  * evicted, then the L2ARC has cached a buffer much sooner than it probably  * needed to, potentially wasting L2ARC device bandwidth and storage.  It is  * safe to say that this is an uncommon case, since buffers at the end of  * the ARC lists have moved there due to inactivity.  *  * 4. If the ARC evicts faster than the L2ARC can maintain a headroom,  * then the L2ARC simply misses copying some buffers.  This serves as a  * pressure valve to prevent heavy read workloads from both stalling the ARC  * with waits and clogging the L2ARC with writes.  This also helps prevent  * the potential for the L2ARC to churn if it attempts to cache content too  * quickly, such as during backups of the entire pool.  *  * 5. After system boot and before the ARC has filled main memory, there are  * no evictions from the ARC and so the tails of the ARC_mfu and ARC_mru  * lists can remain mostly static.  Instead of searching from tail of these  * lists as pictured, the l2arc_feed_thread() will search from the list heads  * for eligible buffers, greatly increasing its chance of finding them.  *  * The L2ARC device write speed is also boosted during this time so that  * the L2ARC warms up faster.  Since there have been no ARC evictions yet,  * there are no L2ARC reads, and no fear of degrading read performance  * through increased writes.  *  * 6. Writes to the L2ARC devices are grouped and sent in-sequence, so that  * the vdev queue can aggregate them into larger and fewer writes.  Each  * device is written to in a rotor fashion, sweeping writes through  * available space then repeating.  *  * 7. The L2ARC does not store dirty content.  It never needs to flush  * write buffers back to disk based storage.  *  * 8. If an ARC buffer is written (and dirtied) which also exists in the  * L2ARC, the now stale L2ARC buffer is immediately dropped.  *  * The performance of the L2ARC can be tweaked by a number of tunables, which  * may be necessary for different workloads:  *  *	l2arc_write_max		max write bytes per interval  *	l2arc_write_boost	extra write bytes during device warmup  *	l2arc_noprefetch	skip caching prefetched buffers  *	l2arc_headroom		number of max device writes to precache  *	l2arc_headroom_boost	when we find compressed buffers during ARC  *				scanning, we multiply headroom by this  *				percentage factor for the next scan cycle,  *				since more compressed buffers are likely to  *				be present  *	l2arc_feed_secs		seconds between L2ARC writing  *  * Tunables may be removed or added as future performance improvements are  * integrated, and also may become zpool properties.  *  * There are three key functions that control how the L2ARC warms up:  *  *	l2arc_write_eligible()	check if a buffer is eligible to cache  *	l2arc_write_size()	calculate how much to write  *	l2arc_write_interval()	calculate sleep delay between writes  *  * These three functions determine what to write, how much, and how quickly  * to send writes.  */
