comment|/*  * Translate an address from the Nth tuple of a device node's reg properties to  * a physical memory address, by applying the range mappings from all ancestors.  * This assumes that all ancestor ranges are simple numerical offsets for which  * addition and subtraction operations will perform the required mapping (the  * bit-options in the high word of standard PCI properties are also handled).  * After the call, *pci_hi (if non-NULL) contains the phys.hi cell of the  * device's parent PCI bus, or OFW_PADDR_NOT_PCI if no PCI bus is involved.  *  * This is intended to be a helper function called by the platform-specific  * implementation of OF_decode_addr(), and not for direct use by device drivers.  */
