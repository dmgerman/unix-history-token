comment|/*  * $FreeBSD$  *  * This module supports memory mapped access to network devices,  * see netmap(4).  *  * The module uses a large, memory pool allocated by the kernel  * and accessible as mmapped memory by multiple userspace threads/processes.  * The memory pool contains packet buffers and "netmap rings",  * i.e. user-accessible copies of the interface's queues.  *  * Access to the network card works like this:  * 1. a process/thread issues one or more open() on /dev/netmap, to create  *    select()able file descriptor on which events are reported.  * 2. on each descriptor, the process issues an ioctl() to identify  *    the interface that should report events to the file descriptor.  * 3. on each descriptor, the process issues an mmap() request to  *    map the shared memory region within the process' address space.  *    The list of interesting queues is indicated by a location in  *    the shared memory region.  * 4. using the functions in the netmap(4) userspace API, a process  *    can look up the occupation state of a queue, access memory buffers,  *    and retrieve received packets or enqueue packets to transmit.  * 5. using some ioctl()s the process can synchronize the userspace view  *    of the queue with the actual status in the kernel. This includes both  *    receiving the notification of new packets, and transmitting new  *    packets on the output interface.  * 6. select() or poll() can be used to wait for events on individual  *    transmit or receive queues (or all queues for a given interface).  *  		SYNCHRONIZATION (USER)  The netmap rings and data structures may be shared among multiple user threads or even independent processes. Any synchronization among those threads/processes is delegated to the threads themselves. Only one thread at a time can be in a system call on the same netmap ring. The OS does not enforce this and only guarantees against system crashes in case of invalid usage.  		LOCKING (INTERNAL)  Within the kernel, access to the netmap rings is protected as follows:  - a spinlock on each ring, to handle producer/consumer races on   RX rings attached to the host stack (against multiple host   threads writing from the host stack to the same ring),   and on 'destination' rings attached to a VALE switch   (i.e. RX rings in VALE ports, and TX rings in NIC/host ports)   protecting multiple active senders for the same destination)  - an atomic variable to guarantee that there is at most one   instance of *_*xsync() on the ring at any time.   For rings connected to user file   descriptors, an atomic_test_and_set() protects this, and the   lock on the ring is not actually used.   For NIC RX rings connected to a VALE switch, an atomic_test_and_set()   is also used to prevent multiple executions (the driver might indeed   already guarantee this).   For NIC TX rings connected to a VALE switch, the lock arbitrates   access to the queue (both when allocating buffers and when pushing   them out).  - *xsync() should be protected against initializations of the card.   On FreeBSD most devices have the reset routine protected by   a RING lock (ixgbe, igb, em) or core lock (re). lem is missing   the RING protection on rx_reset(), this should be added.    On linux there is an external lock on the tx path, which probably   also arbitrates access to the reset routine. XXX to be revised  - a per-interface core_lock protecting access from the host stack   while interfaces may be detached from netmap mode.   XXX there should be no need for this lock if we detach the interfaces   only while they are down.   --- VALE SWITCH ---  NMG_LOCK() serializes all modifications to switches and ports. A switch cannot be deleted until all ports are gone.  For each switch, an SX lock (RWlock on linux) protects deletion of ports. When configuring or deleting a new port, the lock is acquired in exclusive mode (after holding NMG_LOCK). When forwarding, the lock is acquired in shared mode (without NMG_LOCK). The lock is held throughout the entire forwarding cycle, during which the thread may incur in a page fault. Hence it is important that sleepable shared locks are used.  On the rx ring, the per-port lock is grabbed initially to reserve a number of slot in the ring, then the lock is released, packets are copied from source to destination, and then the lock is acquired again and the receive ring is updated. (A similar thing is done on the tx ring for NIC and host stack ports attached to the switch)   */

comment|/* --- internals ----  *  * Roadmap to the code that implements the above.  *  *> 1. a process/thread issues one or more open() on /dev/netmap, to create  *>    select()able file descriptor on which events are reported.  *  *  	Internally, we allocate a netmap_priv_d structure, that will be  *  	initialized on ioctl(NIOCREGIF). There is one netmap_priv_d  *  	structure for each open().  *  *      os-specific:  *  	    FreeBSD: see netmap_open() (netmap_freebsd.c)  *  	    linux:   see linux_netmap_open() (netmap_linux.c)  *  *> 2. on each descriptor, the process issues an ioctl() to identify  *>    the interface that should report events to the file descriptor.  *  * 	Implemented by netmap_ioctl(), NIOCREGIF case, with nmr->nr_cmd==0.  * 	Most important things happen in netmap_get_na() and  * 	netmap_do_regif(), called from there. Additional details can be  * 	found in the comments above those functions.  *  * 	In all cases, this action creates/takes-a-reference-to a  * 	netmap_*_adapter describing the port, and allocates a netmap_if  * 	and all necessary netmap rings, filling them with netmap buffers.  *  *      In this phase, the sync callbacks for each ring are set (these are used  *      in steps 5 and 6 below).  The callbacks depend on the type of adapter.  *      The adapter creation/initialization code puts them in the  * 	netmap_adapter (fields na->nm_txsync and na->nm_rxsync).  Then, they  * 	are copied from there to the netmap_kring's during netmap_do_regif(), by  * 	the nm_krings_create() callback.  All the nm_krings_create callbacks  * 	actually call netmap_krings_create() to perform this and the other  * 	common stuff. netmap_krings_create() also takes care of the host rings,  * 	if needed, by setting their sync callbacks appropriately.  *  * 	Additional actions depend on the kind of netmap_adapter that has been  * 	registered:  *  * 	- netmap_hw_adapter:  	     [netmap.c]  * 	     This is a system netdev/ifp with native netmap support.  * 	     The ifp is detached from the host stack by redirecting:  * 	       - transmissions (from the network stack) to netmap_transmit()  * 	       - receive notifications to the nm_notify() callback for  * 	         this adapter. The callback is normally netmap_notify(), unless  * 	         the ifp is attached to a bridge using bwrap, in which case it  * 	         is netmap_bwrap_intr_notify().  *  * 	- netmap_generic_adapter:      [netmap_generic.c]  * 	      A system netdev/ifp without native netmap support.  *  * 	(the decision about native/non native support is taken in  * 	 netmap_get_hw_na(), called by netmap_get_na())  *  * 	- netmap_vp_adapter 		[netmap_vale.c]  * 	      Returned by netmap_get_bdg_na().  * 	      This is a persistent or ephemeral VALE port. Ephemeral ports  * 	      are created on the fly if they don't already exist, and are  * 	      always attached to a bridge.  * 	      Persistent VALE ports must must be created separately, and i  * 	      then attached like normal NICs. The NIOCREGIF we are examining  * 	      will find them only if they had previosly been created and  * 	      attached (see VALE_CTL below).  *  * 	- netmap_pipe_adapter 	      [netmap_pipe.c]  * 	      Returned by netmap_get_pipe_na().  * 	      Both pipe ends are created, if they didn't already exist.  *  * 	- netmap_monitor_adapter      [netmap_monitor.c]  * 	      Returned by netmap_get_monitor_na().  * 	      If successful, the nm_sync callbacks of the monitored adapter  * 	      will be intercepted by the returned monitor.  *  * 	- netmap_bwrap_adapter	      [netmap_vale.c]  * 	      Cannot be obtained in this way, see VALE_CTL below  *  *  * 	os-specific:  * 	    linux: we first go through linux_netmap_ioctl() to  * 	           adapt the FreeBSD interface to the linux one.  *  *  *> 3. on each descriptor, the process issues an mmap() request to  *>    map the shared memory region within the process' address space.  *>    The list of interesting queues is indicated by a location in  *>    the shared memory region.  *  *      os-specific:  *  	    FreeBSD: netmap_mmap_single (netmap_freebsd.c).  *  	    linux:   linux_netmap_mmap (netmap_linux.c).  *  *> 4. using the functions in the netmap(4) userspace API, a process  *>    can look up the occupation state of a queue, access memory buffers,  *>    and retrieve received packets or enqueue packets to transmit.  *  * 	these actions do not involve the kernel.  *  *> 5. using some ioctl()s the process can synchronize the userspace view  *>    of the queue with the actual status in the kernel. This includes both  *>    receiving the notification of new packets, and transmitting new  *>    packets on the output interface.  *  * 	These are implemented in netmap_ioctl(), NIOCTXSYNC and NIOCRXSYNC  * 	cases. They invoke the nm_sync callbacks on the netmap_kring  * 	structures, as initialized in step 2 and maybe later modified  * 	by a monitor. Monitors, however, will always call the original  * 	callback before doing anything else.  *  *  *> 6. select() or poll() can be used to wait for events on individual  *>    transmit or receive queues (or all queues for a given interface).  *  * 	Implemented in netmap_poll(). This will call the same nm_sync()  * 	callbacks as in step 5 above.  *  * 	os-specific:  * 		linux: we first go through linux_netmap_poll() to adapt  * 		       the FreeBSD interface to the linux one.  *  *  *  ----  VALE_CTL -----  *  *  VALE switches are controlled by issuing a NIOCREGIF with a non-null  *  nr_cmd in the nmreq structure. These subcommands are handled by  *  netmap_bdg_ctl() in netmap_vale.c. Persistent VALE ports are created  *  and destroyed by issuing the NETMAP_BDG_NEWIF and NETMAP_BDG_DELIF  *  subcommands, respectively.  *  *  Any network interface known to the system (including a persistent VALE  *  port) can be attached to a VALE switch by issuing the  *  NETMAP_BDG_ATTACH subcommand. After the attachment, persistent VALE ports  *  look exactly like ephemeral VALE ports (as created in step 2 above).  The  *  attachment of other interfaces, instead, requires the creation of a  *  netmap_bwrap_adapter.  Moreover, the attached interface must be put in  *  netmap mode. This may require the creation of a netmap_generic_adapter if  *  we have no native support for the interface, or if generic adapters have  *  been forced by sysctl.  *  *  Both persistent VALE ports and bwraps are handled by netmap_get_bdg_na(),  *  called by nm_bdg_ctl_attach(), and discriminated by the nm_bdg_attach()  *  callback.  In the case of the bwrap, the callback creates the  *  netmap_bwrap_adapter.  The initialization of the bwrap is then  *  completed by calling netmap_do_regif() on it, in the nm_bdg_ctl()  *  callback (netmap_bwrap_bdg_ctl in netmap_vale.c).  *  A generic adapter for the wrapped ifp will be created if needed, when  *  netmap_get_bdg_na() calls netmap_get_hw_na().  *  *  *  ---- DATAPATHS -----  *  *              -= SYSTEM DEVICE WITH NATIVE SUPPORT =-  *  *    na == NA(ifp) == netmap_hw_adapter created in DEVICE_netmap_attach()  *  *    -

comment|/*  * Handlers for synchronization of the rings from/to the host stack.  * These are associated to a network interface and are just another  * ring pair managed by userspace.  *  * Netmap also supports transparent forwarding (NS_FORWARD and NR_FORWARD  * flags):  *  * - Before releasing buffers on hw RX rings, the application can mark  *   them with the NS_FORWARD flag. During the next RXSYNC or poll(), they  *   will be forwarded to the host stack, similarly to what happened if  *   the application moved them to the host TX ring.  *  * - Before releasing buffers on the host RX ring, the application can  *   mark them with the NS_FORWARD flag. During the next RXSYNC or poll(),  *   they will be forwarded to the hw TX rings, saving the application  *   from doing the same task in user-space.  *  * Transparent fowarding can be enabled per-ring, by setting the NR_FORWARD  * flag, or globally with the netmap_fwd sysctl.  *  * The transfer NIC --> host is relatively easy, just encapsulate  * into mbufs and we are done. The host --> NIC side is slightly  * harder because there might not be room in the tx ring so it  * might take a while before releasing the buffer.  */
