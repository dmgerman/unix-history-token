comment|/*  * This file defines interfaces for the mmc bridge.  The names chosen  * are similar to or the same as the names used in Linux to allow for  * easy porting of what Linux calls mmc host drivers.  I use the  * FreeBSD terminology of bridge and bus for consistency with other  * drivers in the system.  This file corresponds roughly to the Linux  * linux/mmc/host.h file.  *  * A mmc bridge is a chipset that can have one or more mmc and/or sd  * cards attached to it.  mmc cards are attached on a bus topology,  * while sd and sdio cards are attached using a star topology (meaning  * in practice each sd card has its own, independent slot).  Each  * mmcbr is assumed to be derived from the mmcbr.  This is done to  * allow for easier addition of bridges (as each bridge does not need  * to be added to the mmcbus file).  *  * Attached to the mmc bridge is an mmcbus.  The mmcbus is described  * in dev/mmc/mmcbus_if.m.  */
