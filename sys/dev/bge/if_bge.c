comment|/*  * Broadcom BCM57xx(x)/BCM590x NetXtreme and NetLink family Ethernet driver  *  * The Broadcom BCM5700 is based on technology originally developed by  * Alteon Networks as part of the Tigon I and Tigon II Gigabit Ethernet  * MAC chips. The BCM5700, sometimes referred to as the Tigon III, has  * two on-board MIPS R4000 CPUs and can have as much as 16MB of external  * SSRAM. The BCM5700 supports TCP, UDP and IP checksum offload, jumbo  * frames, highly configurable RX filtering, and 16 RX and TX queues  * (which, along with RX filter rules, can be used for QOS applications).  * Other features, such as TCP segmentation, may be available as part  * of value-added firmware updates. Unlike the Tigon I and Tigon II,  * firmware images can be stored in hardware and need not be compiled  * into the driver.  *  * The BCM5700 supports the PCI v2.2 and PCI-X v1.0 standards, and will  * function in a 32-bit/64-bit 33/66Mhz bus, or a 64-bit/133Mhz bus.  *  * The BCM5701 is a single-chip solution incorporating both the BCM5700  * MAC and a BCM5401 10/100/1000 PHY. Unlike the BCM5700, the BCM5701  * does not support external SSRAM.  *  * Broadcom also produces a variation of the BCM5700 under the "Altima"  * brand name, which is functionally similar but lacks PCI-X support.  *  * Without external SSRAM, you can only have at most 4 TX rings,  * and the use of the mini RX ring is disabled. This seems to imply  * that these features are simply not available on the BCM5701. As a  * result, this driver does not implement any support for the mini RX  * ring.  */

The driver is then responsible to passing the 	 *   buffer up to the stack.

comment|/* 	 * Ack the interrupt by writing something to BGE_MBX_IRQ0_LO.  Don't 	 * disable interrupts by writing nonzero like we used to, since with 	 * our current organization this just gives complications and 	 * pessimizations for re-enabling interrupts.  We used to have races 	 * instead of the necessary complications.  Disabling interrupts 	 * would just reduce the chance of a status update while we are 	 * running (by switching to the interrupt-mode coalescence 	 * parameters), but this chance is already very low so it is more 	 * efficient to get another interrupt than prevent it. 	 * 	 * We do the ack first to ensure another interrupt if there is a 	 * status update after the ack.  We don't check for the status 	 * changing later because it is more efficient to get another 	 * interrupt than prevent it, not quite as above (not checking is 	 * a smaller optimization than not toggling the interrupt enable, 	 * since checking doesn't involve PCI accesses and toggling require 	 * the status check).  So toggling would probably be a pessimization 	 * even with MSI.  It would only be needed for using a task queue. 	 */
