comment|/*  * This is a driver for the Xircom CreditCard Netwave (also known as  * the Netwave Airsurfer) wireless LAN PCMCIA adapter.  *  * When this driver was developed, the Linux Netwave driver was used  * as a hardware manual. That driver is Copyright (c) 1997 University  * of Tromsø, Norway. It is part of the Linix pcmcia-cs package that  * can be found at  * http://hyper.stanford.edu/HyperNews/get/pcmcia/home.html. The most  * recent version of the pcmcia-cs package when this driver was  * written was 3.0.6.  *  * Unfortunately, a lot of explicit numeric constants were used in the  * Linux driver. I have tried to use symbolic names whenever possible,  * but since I don't have any real hardware documentation, there's  * still one or two "magic numbers" :-(.  *  * Driver limitations: This driver doesn't do multicasting or receiver  * promiscuity, because of missing hardware documentation. I couldn't  * get receiver promiscuity to work, and I haven't even tried  * multicast. Volunteers are welcome, of course :-).  */

comment|/*  * The card appears to work much better when we only allow one packet  * "in the air" at a time.  This is done by not allowing another packet  * on the card, even if there is room.  Turning this off will allow the  * driver to stuff packets on the card as soon as a transmit buffer is  * available.  This does increase the number of collisions, though.  * We can que a second packet if there are transmit buffers available,  * but we do not actually send the packet until the last packet has  * been written.  */
