When our domain is operating in PV mode,  * the grant table mechanism directly updates our domain's page table entries  * to point to the physical pages of the remote domain.  This scheme guarantees  * that blkback and the backing devices it uses can safely perform DMA  * operations to satisfy requests.  In HVM mode, Xen may use a HW IOMMU to  * insure that our domain cannot DMA to pages owned by another domain.  As  * of Xen 4.0, IOMMU mappings for HVM guests are not updated via the grant  * table API.  For this reason, in HVM mode, we must bounce all requests into  * memory that is mapped into our domain at domain startup and thus has  * valid IOMMU mappings.  */
