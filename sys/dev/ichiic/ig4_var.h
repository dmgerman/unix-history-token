comment|/* 	 * Locking semantics: 	 * 	 * Functions implementing the icbus interface that interact 	 * with the controller acquire an exclusive lock on call_lock 	 * to prevent interleaving of calls to the interface and a lock on 	 * io_lock right afterwards, to synchronize controller I/O activity. 	 * 	 * The interrupt handler can only read data while no iicbus call 	 * is in progress or while io_lock is dropped during mtx_sleep in 	 * wait_status and set_controller. It is safe to drop io_lock in those 	 * places, because the interrupt handler only accesses those registers: 	 * 	 * - IG4_REG_I2C_STA  (I2C Status) 	 * - IG4_REG_DATA_CMD (Data Buffer and Command) 	 * - IG4_REG_CLR_INTR (Clear Interrupt) 	 * 	 * Locking outside of those places is required to make the content 	 * of rpos/rnext predictable (e.g. whenever data_read is called and in 	 * ig4iic_transfer). 	 */
