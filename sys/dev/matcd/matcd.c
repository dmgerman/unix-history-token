Dedicated to:	My family, my Grandfather, 		and Max, my Golden Retriever  Thanks to:	Jordan Hubbard (jkh) for getting me ramped-up to 2.x system 		quickly enough to make the 2.1 release.  He put up with 		plenty of silly questions and might get the post of 		ambassador some day.  and 		The people who donated equipment and other material to make 		development of this driver possible.  Donations and 		sponsors for projects are appreciated.  -----No changes should be needed above this line-----------------------------  Edit History - (should be in sync with any source control log entries)  	Never seen one of these sections before?  Ok, here is how it works. 	Every time you change the code, you increment the ANSI edit number, 	that number over there in the<%d> and in the (%d) in the 	version string.  You never set this number lower than it is. 	Near, or preferably on lines that change, insert the edit 	number.  If there is a number there already, you can replace it 	with a newer one.  This makes searches for code changes very fast.  	In the edit history, start with the edit number, and a good 	description of what changes were made.  Then follow it with 	the date, your name and an EMAIL address where you can be reached.  	Please follow this practice; it helps leave understandable code in 	your wake.  	ANSI version codes have major and minor release numbers.  Major 	releases numbered 1 thru n.  Major feature additions should get a new 	major release number.  Minor releases start with a null and then 	letters A thru Z as needed.  So  3A(456) is Major release 3, Minor 	release 1, Edit 456 (the equivalent in XX.XX.XX version numbering used 	by certain monopolies would be 03.01.456), and 5(731) is Major release 	5, Minor release 0, Edit 731.  Typically only the author will change 	the major and minor release codes in small projects.  				EDIT edit Edit HISTORY history History<1>	This initial version is to get basic filesystem I/O working 	using the SoundBlaster 16 interface.  The stand-alone adapter 	card doesn't work yet. 	December 1994  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<2>	Corrections to resolve a race condition when multiple drives 	on the same controller was active.  Fixed drive 1& 2 swap 	problem.  See selectdrive(). 	21-Jan-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<3>	Added automatic probing and support for all Creative Labs sound 	cards with the Creative/Panasonic interface and the stand-alone 	interface adapters.  See AUTOHUNT and FULLCONFIG conditionals 	for more information. 	21-Jan-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<4>	Rebundled debug conditionals. 	14-Feb-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<5>	Changes needed to work on FreeBSD 2.1.  Also added draincmd 	since some conditions cause the drive to produce surprise data. 	See setmode and draincmd 	19-Feb-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<6>	Got rid of some redundant error code by creating chk_error(). 	Also built a nice generic bus-lock function. 	20-Feb-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<7>	Improved comments, general structuring. 	Fixed a problem with disc eject not working if LOCKDRIVE was set. 	Apparently the drive will reject an EJECT command if the drive 	is LOCKED. 	21-Feb-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<8>	Final device name selected and actually made to compile under>2.0. For newer systems, it is "matcd", for older it is "mat". 	24-Feb-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<9>	Added some additional disk-related ioctl functions that didn't 	make it into earlier versions. 	26-Feb-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<10>	Updated some conditionals so the code will compile under 	1.1.5.1, although this is not the supported platform. 	Also found that some other devices probe code was changing the 	settings for the port 0x302 debug board, so added code to set it 	to a sane state before we use it. 	26-Feb-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<11>	The Copyright and Use statement has been replaced in all files 	with a new version. 	01-Mar-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<12>	Added ioctls having to do with audio volume, routing and playback 	speed.  Also added some code I think is for dynamic loading. 	12-Mar-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<13>	Added ioctls to return TOC headers and entries. 	19-Mar-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<14>	More ioctls to finish out general audio support and some clean-up. 	Also fixed a bug in open where CD label information would not 	always be cleared after a disc change.  	Added a check to block attempts to resume audio if already playing. 	The resulting sound is a cross between Kryten and Max Headroom. 	But, if you *want* this "feature", enable #define KRYTEN 	in options.h.  	Complaints about too many comments are noted but that is all.  :-) 	21-Mar-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<15>	LOCKDRIVE has been modified so that a new series of minor 	numbers are created.  When these are opened, the selected 	drive will have its door locked and the device must be completely 	closed to unlock the media.  The EJECT ioctl will be refused 	when the drive is locked this way.   This is useful for 	servers and other places where the media needs to remain in the 	drive.  Bit 7 of the minor number controls locking.  	As of this edit, the code compiles with no warnings with -Wall set. 	22-Mar-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<16>	Added a new check in the probe code that looks for the drive 	interface being in an idle state after issuing a reset.  If this 	isn't the case, then the device at this location isn't a 	Matsushita CD-ROM drive.  This will prevent hangs in draincmd later. 	Added the tray close ioctl.  This required modifications to open 	to allow the character devices to be "partially" opened so that 	the close ioctl could be issued when the open would otherwise fail. 	Close also delays slightly after completing because the drive 	doesn't update its disc and media status instantly. 	Also created the capability ioctl that lets an application find out 	up front what things a drive can do. 	Fixed a global spelling error. 	Changed matcddriver structure to simply say "matcd".  The original 	string "matcd interface " broke the kernel -c boot mechanism. 	Updated the #includes in response to a complaint in first release. 	Updated and tested conditionals so that driver will still compile 	under FreeBSD 1.1.5.1 as well as 2.0 and early 2.1. 	04-Apr-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<17>	The function matcd_toc_entries which is executed in response to 	the CDIOREADTOCENTRYS ioctl didn't cope with programs that only 	requested part of the TOC.  This change is based on code submitted 	by Doug Robson (dfr@render.com). 	(This change was introduced out of order and exists in FreeBSD 	 2.0.5 without the version stamp being updated.  I.N.M.F.) 	01-Jun-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<18>	While working on the TEAC CD-ROM driver (teaccd) that is reusing 	chunks of code from this driver, I discovered several functions, 	arrays and other things that should have been declared 'static'. 	These changes are necessary if the TEAC CD-ROM driver is to be 	present at the same time as matcd. 	Also fixed the residual buss vs bus symbols and strings. 	There are no functional code changes in this edit. 	02-May-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<19>	Creative has changed the Status port slightly in their 	sound boards based on the Vibra-16 (and probably the Vibra-16S) 	chipset.  This change masks some unused bits that were formally 	on all the time and are doing different things in this design. 	The changes are transparent to all other supported boards. 	20-Jun-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<20>	Code was added to detect non-Creative (SoundBlaster) host 	interfaces, and the driver will  switch to code compatible with the 	detected host interface.  This should add support for MediaVision, 	IBM, Reveal, and other compatible adapters with split 	data/status-ports.  This code allows a mix of SoundBlaster (Type 0) 	and non-SoundBlaster (Type 1) boards in the same system with no 	special configuration.  	I also updated the attach code to display the interface type and 	changed the host interface probe messages to reflect the "c" for 	controller in controller-specific messages as the existing messages 	were confusing when a second card was in place .  The kernel -c 	tables have been updated accordingly, so you now have a matcdc%d 	controller to change settings on. 	24-Jun-95  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<21>	Added interface handling code in two of those "this should not 	happen" routines, draincmd and get_stat.   Since these routines are 	called by functions during probing that may not know what type 	interface is out there, the code assumes that a given adapter is 	both a type 0 and a type 1 adapter at the same time.  Plus, 	this code gets executed once in a very long time so the cost of 	assuming both host adapter types is not significant. 	04-Jul-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<22>	Four external interface prototypes were altered by someone else. 	I believe these changes are for making GCC and/or the linker shut-up 	when building some other part of the system since matcd already 	compiles -Wall with no warnings... 	08-Sep-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<23>	This change implements the ioctls for preventing media removal 	and allowing media removal. 	Currently, these calls will work according to the following rules: 			No "l" devs opened	Any "l" dev open 	CDALLOW		accepted always		rejected always 	CDPREVENT	accepted always		accepted always  	One refinement might be to allow CDALLOW/CDPREVENT to always 	work if UID 0 issued the ioctl, but that will wait for later.  	I also made a change to the information that the toc_entry code 	returns so that xcdplayer won't malfunction.  (It would not play 	the last track on a non-mixed mode audio CD.)  Unlike cdplayer, 	xcdplayer asks for track information one track at a time, and 	calls for information on the lead-out track by its official 	number (0xaa), rather than referring to the "after last" (n+1) track 	as cdplayer does.  Anyway, this change should make both players 	happy. 	16-Sep-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<24>	In Edit 15 when the extra devs were created for selective locking, 	the door locking was broken if a non-locking dev on the drive is 	closed.  The problem was caused by not tracking locked devs and 	non-locking devs as being different partitions.   The change is to 	simply use the locking dev bit to flag a set of shadow partitions 	when it comes to lock operations.  All other operations treat the 	locked and unlocked partitions as being identical. 	18-Sep-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<25>	During work on Edit 23, I noted that on slow and very busy systems, 	sometimes the driver would go to sleep forever.  The problem appears 	to have been a race condition caused by doing separate timeout/sleep 	calls without using SPL first.  The change here is to use tsleep 	which provides the equivalent of timeout/sleep timeout/tsleep if the 	last paremeter is tsleep is set to the time value that would have been 	given to timeout. 	I also fixed some duplicate location strings in the tsleep calls. 	24-Sep-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<26>	Moved a function declaration that generated two warnings with 	the FULLCONFIG/FULLDRIVER conditionals disabled. 	Updated the igot function so that it correctly reports limited 	functions when a sub-set driver is compiled. 	Eliminated FULLCONFIG conditional and now set controller counts 	based on the NMATCD #define produced by the config process. 	Also, disable the audio-related ioctls based on the BOOTMFS 	conditional to help make the boot floppy kernel smaller. 	18-Oct-1995  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<27>	An unknown number of modifications were made by third parties 	after edit 26, but they neglected to document everything that 	was changed and why.  These are known collectively as edit 27.  	All Edit 27 changes were later discarded as part of the creation 	of Release 3, as some of the changes became incompatible with 	FreeBSD 4.x/5.x, and some broke drive operations that used to work. 	January 2003	Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org  Begin work on Major Release 3 here<28>	Begin work on converting the code to run on FreeBSD 5.0.  This 	included making the driver into a loadable kernel module, and 	interfacing with the new port allocator scheme.  This code is not 	based off what was in 4.6, but comes from the last version I 	personally submitted to the project, thus eliminating some fluff that 	crept in over the years.  The conditionally-compiled sections for 	building on pre-FreeBSD 2.0 releases have been removed, as it was 	likely not useful to anyone anymore.  	I reclaimed Major device 46 for matcd - it was dropped from the 5.0 	"majors" file - but as of this date it has not been reassigned to 	some other device. 	10-Jan-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<29>	Work to adapt to the new way of passing key settings around between 	functions and calls to the driver that seems to be forced on loadable 	drivers or perhaps all drivers.  This required substantial debugging 	as the port addresses identified during probing were not reaching 	all the functions that needed that information. 	14-Jan-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<30>	Work continues, and matcd successfully loads and unloads itself and 	creates and cleans up its devs on repeated kldload/kldunloads. 	Notice: Because the dev_depends() kernel call for internally linking 	multiple devs to a master dev does not appear to exist prior to 5.0  	(was not present in 4.6 or 4.7 releases), the dev create/cleanup 	code may not link on older versions, not without commenting out 	parts of that section of the driver.  See matcd_attach. 	09-Feb-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<31>	Open() now does everything it is supposed to, and completes 	successfully.  It isn't clear if disable_intr/enable_intr is 	definitely going to prevent the drive commands from being issued 	within 10msec, but this seems to be the calls to now use in place 	of spl(7)/splx(). 	13-Feb-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<32>	Strategy code changed to deal with the newer mechanisms for handling 	request queues that exists in 5.0.  The driver will now mount and 	read an ISO filesystem. 	17-Feb-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<33>	A sweep through the code to eliminate compiler warnings.  The code now 	produces just one warning in the timeout() call, and so far this one 	evades elimination.  This edit also started to remove some now-dead 	code, unneccessary includes and debug code inserted during the 	previous two edits while trying to get basic functions working again. 	22-Feb-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<34>	Removal of the DIAGPORT code.  Although very useful during original 	development and for troubleshooting some problems found by others, it 	is no longer practical to keep, partly due to the way port allocation 	is now handled in FreeBSD, but mostly because of how few motherboards 	still have slots that will accomodate these diagnostic cards, most 	of which were ISA.  This presence of this code, even though ifdef-ed 	out in all earlier finished FreeBSD releases, still drove some of 	the other developers nuts for unclear reasons, but they should be 	happy now... :-) 	02-Mar-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<35>	Work to make the FULLDRIVER conditional build still compile.  This 	inserts the audio and special ioctls not needed to be able to perform 	simple single-session filesystem mounts, and was used to keep the 	boot floppy kernel size down.  This work was mainly just re-working 	the way our internal data was passed around between functions (See 	edit 29), and tracking down declarations that have moved from one 	include file to another.  Since all the code for talking to the 	actual drives worked previously, only the interface back to the rest 	of the kernel and calling apps needs any modernization. 	09-Mar-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<36>	Once work was complete on getting the FULLDRIVER audio functions 	compiling again, suddenly we could not mount filesystems anymore. 	This was eventually traced to a previously-not-performed-ioctl-call, 	now made by some other part of the kernel immediately after an open() 	call succeeds.  This ioctl reads the TOC for all tracks on the disc. 	Who is making this ioctl call (and what the answers are good for) 	is not immediately apparent.  	However, when FULLDRIVER wasn't present, this ioctl code was not 	available and the driver returned an error to the ioctl, but the mount 	succeeded anyway and the filesystem could be used with no issues. 	When the ioctl code was there (as a result of FULLDRIVER build), it 	was returning the information requested in MSF format, and this was 	confusing the caller.  	When matcd was originally written, returning MSF was all that the 	original CD audio players ever wanted, but this new mount-time 	query wants the answers in LBA format.  So the READTOC call has been 	updated to return either MSF or LBA formats.  Having implemented 	that, filesystems can be mounted again. 	16-Mar-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<37>	Related to Edit 36, when the various ioctls were updated to return 	the offset information that was requested in either LBA or MSF 	format, that broke the cdcontrol utility, which will request 	information (via the "stat" command) in LBA or MSF based on the last 	setting of the "set" command, but cdcontrol displays bogus results if 	LBA results are returned when cdcontrol asked for them.  An 	examination of the behavior of the IDE CD-ROM driver shows that for 	SUBQ data, the IDE driver ignores the format type in the request and 	always returns MSF format, and that seems to be what cdcontrol really 	wants, never mind what it asked for.  Subsequently, a conditional 	(SUBQRETREQUESTED) has been added which will direct the driver to 	always return MSF in response to SUBQ queries (default), or to return 	what the caller actually asked for.  This probably should not be 	activated until all other CD-ROM drivers and cdcontrol are fixed 	on this point. 	22-Mar-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<38>	A revisit of the compiler warning on timeout() that just refuses to go 	away.  A review of other drivers using timeout() suggests that the 	way timeout() is used within the kernel has been changed from 	traditional calling and passed parameters.  This call has no man page 	(apparently not even a reference in an include file exists) which 	makes confirmation difficult.  Further, as the timeout is not used 	predictably by the driver (sometimes needed, sometimes not), testing a 	change in this area will take some stress/duration testing. 	26-Mar-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<39>	Two hardware failure conditions were identified when a eight-drive, 	two controller configuration was tested.  Some types of cable 	failure are now detected and reported by the driver.  Other failure 	modes are documented here for reference: 	1.	If the firmware version string displayed during the driver 		probing process (normally of the form) "[CR-NNNN.NN]" is 		displayed as "[]", or "[          ]" indicates that two or 		more drives are jumpered with the same drive select.  This 		condition may be accompanied by other strange random messages.  	2.	A firmware Version string "[^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A]" indicates 		that the cable used on the Matsushita drive appears to be 		an IDE cable which has a pin pulled out of it (when this is 		done, it is usually in the key position).  A fully-pinned 		cable must be used.  A cable with shorts to ground or opens 		on numerous lines can also cause this symptom.  	3.	If the driver refuses to go into Idle state, this indicates 		a bad cable OR a power-supply under-volt condition.  The 		drives appear to stay in a Data or Status phase indefinitely 		if the supply voltages are below +5 and +12 VDC.  The drive 		BUSY light may also remain lit continuously or the eject 		button may be ignored.  	The rest of this edit was more clean-up and removal of some debug 	messages. 	02-Apr-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<40>	Replaced Copyright text section in all files with the new revisionist 	(and vague) one currently required.  Everybody should be happy.  :-) 	03-Apr-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<41>	Rebuilt on a stock 5.0-RELEASE platform to look for any issues 	that crept in since the late 2002 snapshot I had been using and 	to verify functionality on a dual-processor system.  	Changed the ioctl for eject so that it would work when there was 	no media in the drive.  The way it was seemed obviously wrong, but no 	one had said anything about this behavior in all the years it has 	worked that way.  	Also discovered that some of the ioctls failed to lock the device 	prior to issuing commands, and this could cause other operations 	to that same drive to not start and hang forever.  Example, 	"strings /dev" on one process while another issues an eject.  Yes, 	the "strings" will end up getting an error, but that is what should 	happen, not having "strings" simply stop and never come back. 	18-Apr-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org<42>	Changes to make matcd.c compile again on a 6-May-2003 pre-Beta 5.1 	cvsup, as the deck chairs continue to shift. 	o	Dropped tests for DIOCWLABEL on reads, which is now undefined. 	o	bioqdisksort() in the kernel depths changed its name from 5.0.* 	o	bounds_check_with_label() kernel call disappeared since 5.0 		with no apparent replacement.* 	o	The way the cdevsw structure is done has changed for the nth 		time.  It differs from what existed in 5.0. 	o	Dropped ioctl support for DIOCWDINFO and DIOCSDINFO. 		Although both ioctls are still defined in system include 		files, the setdisklabel() that I need to call to perform 		the ioctls has disappeared since 5.0. 	* Items marked are in the ifdef NOTEDIT42 rather than deleting 	  code that refers to kernel calls that may mysteriously return 	  in some future check-in. 	10-May-2003  Frank Durda IV	uhclem at freebsd.org  End of Edit History ---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

comment|/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	matcd_probe - Search for host interface/adapters  	The probe routine hunts for the first drive on the interface since 	there is no way to locate just the adapter.   It also resets the 	entire drive chain while it is there.  matcd_attach() takes care of 	the rest of the initialization.  	The probe routine can be compiled two ways.  In AUTOHUNT mode, 	the kernel config file can say "port?" and we will check all ports 	listed in the port_hint array (see above).  	Without AUTOHUNT set, the config file must list a specific port 	address to check.  	Note that specifying the explicit addresses makes boot-up a lot 	faster.  	The probe will locate Panasonic/Creative interface on the following 	Creative adapter boards: 		#1330A	Sound Blaster PRO 		#1730	Sound Blaster 16 		#1740	Sound Blaster 16 (cost reduced) 		#2230	Sound Blaster 16 (cost reduced) 		#2770	Sound Blaster 16 Value (cost reduced) 		#1810	omniCD upgrade kit adapter card (stand-alone CD) 		#3100	PhoneBlaster SB16 + Sierra 14.4K modem combo 	Creative releases a newer and cheaper-to-make Sound Blaster 	board every few months, so by the original release date of this 	software, there are probably 8 different board models called 	Sound Blaster 16.  These include "Vibra", "Value", etc.  	Please report additional part numbers and board descriptions 	and new port numbers that work to the author.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

However in special 	cases, the drives return blocks of data that are not associated 	with the command in question.  This appears to be at least one 	firmware error and the rest of the driver makes an effort to avoid 	triggering the fault.  However, when this situation occurs, simply 	reading and throwing-away this bogus data is faster and less 	destructive than resetting all the drives on a given controller to get 	back in sync, plus not resetting leaves the other drives unaffected. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

NOTE -	Undocumented action of hardware:  If you change (or reaffirm) data 	modes with MODESELECT + BLOCKPARAM immediately after a command was 	issued that aborted a DA play operation, the drive will unexpectedly 	return 2532 bytes of data in a data phase on the first or second 	subsequent command.  	Original Symptom: drive will refuse to go idle after reading data 	and status expected for a command.

comment|/*	This function sets the audio playback rate.  In SCSI devices this is 	referred to as the logical block addresses per second parameter. 	Uh huh.  Sounds like they didn't want anyone to find it. 	Anyway, a study found that no one else has implemented this ioctl 	but the capability does exist in the SCSI standard so I am following 	the SCSI scheme even though it really doesn't fit this drive well.  	I originally defined the parameter to this ioctl as -32767 to -1 	being "play slower", 0x0000 flat and 1 to 32767 being "play faster" 	within the scale allowed by the device.  The value is scaled to fit 	the range allowed by the device and any excess is treated as being 	the positive or negative limit.  No ioctl input pitch value is 	considered invalid.  	This device has a +/- 13% playback pitch specified by a range 	-130 to +130.  The drive does a hard enforcement on this.  	SCSI defines a 16 bit LBAS count, and a "multiplier" that 	is either x1 or x(1/256).  The Matsushita drive only provides 	10 bits total for indicating pitch so the LSbits are discarded. */
