comment|/*  * Helper code to recover a hung i2c bus by bit-banging a recovery sequence.  *  * An i2c bus can be hung by a slave driving the clock (rare) or data lines low.  * The most common cause is a partially-completed transaction such as rebooting  * while a slave is sending a byte of data.  Because i2c allows the clock to  * freeze for any amount of time, the slave device will continue driving the  * data line until power is removed, or the clock cycles enough times to  * complete the current byte.  After completing any partial byte, a START/STOP  * sequence resets the slave and the bus is recovered.  *  * Any i2c driver which is able to manually set the level of the clock and data  * lines can use this common code for bus recovery.  On many SOCs that have  * embedded i2c controllers, the i2c pins can be temporarily reassigned as gpio  * pins to do the bus recovery, then can be assigned back to the i2c hardware.  */
