comment|/*  * if_wl.c - original MACH, then BSDI ISA wavelan driver  *	ported to mach by Anders Klemets  *	to BSDI by Robert Morris  *	to FreeBSD by Jim Binkley  *      to FreeBSD 2.2+ by Michael Smith  *  * 2.2 update:  * Changed interface to match 2.1-2.2 differences.  * Implement IRQ selection logic in wlprobe()  * Implement PSA updating.  * Pruned heading comments for relevance.  * Ripped out all the 'interface counters' cruft.  * Cut the missing-interrupt timer back to 100ms.  * 2.2.1 update:  * now supports all multicast mode (mrouted will work),  *	but unfortunately must do that by going into promiscuous mode  * NWID sysctl added so that normally promiscuous mode is NWID-specific  *	but can be made NWID-inspecific  *			7/14/97 jrb  *  * Work done:  * Ported to FreeBSD, got promiscuous mode working with bpfs,  * and rewired timer routine.  The i82586 will hang occasionally on output   * and the watchdog timer will kick it if so and log an entry.  * 2 second timeout there.  Apparently the chip loses an interrupt.  * Code borrowed from if_ie.c for watchdog timer.  *  * The wavelan card is a 2mbit radio modem that emulates ethernet;  * i.e., it uses MAC addresses.  This should not be a surprise since  * it uses an ethernet controller as a major hw item.  * It can broadcast, unicast or apparently multicast in a base cell   * using an omni-directional antennae that is   * about 800 feet around the base cell barring walls and metal.    * With directional antennae, it can be used point to point over a mile  * or so apparently (haven't tried that).  *  * There are ISA and pcmcia versions (not supported by this code).  * The ISA card has an Intel 82586 lan controller on it.  It consists  * of 2 pieces of hw, the lan controller (intel) and a radio-modem.  * The latter has an extra set of controller registers that has nothing  * to do with the i82586 and allows setting and monitoring of radio  * signal strength, etc.  There is a nvram area called the PSA that  * contains a number of setup variables including the IRQ and so-called  * NWID or Network ID.  The NWID must be set the same for all radio  * cards to communicate (unless you are using the ATT/NCR roaming feature  * with their access points.  There is no support for that here. Roaming  * involves a link-layer beacon sent out from the access points.  End  * stations monitor the signal strength and only use the strongest  * access point).  This driver assumes that the base ISA port, IRQ,   * and NWID are first set in nvram via the dos-side "instconf.exe" utility   * supplied with the card. This driver takes the ISA port from   * the kernel configuration setup, and then determines the IRQ either   * from the kernel config (if an explicit IRQ is set) or from the   * PSA on the card if not.  * The hw also magically just uses the IRQ set in the nvram.  * The NWID is used magically as well by the radio-modem  * to determine which packets to keep or throw out.    *  * sample config:  *  * device wl0 at isa? port 0x300 net irq ?  *  * Ifdefs:  * 1. WLDEBUG. (off) - if turned on enables IFF_DEBUG set via ifconfig debug  * 2. MULTICAST (on) - turned on and works up to and including mrouted  * 3. WLCACHE (off) -  define to turn on a signal strength   * (and other metric) cache that is indexed by sender MAC address.    * Apps can read this out to learn the remote signal strength of a   * sender.  Note that it has a switch so that it only stores   * broadcast/multicast senders but it could be set to store unicast   * too only.  Size is hardwired in if_wl_wavelan.h  *  * one further note: promiscuous mode is a curious thing.  In this driver,  * promiscuous mode apparently CAN catch ALL packets and ignore the NWID  * setting.  This is probably more useful in a sense (for snoopers) if  * you are interested in all traffic as opposed to if you are interested  * in just your own.  There is a driver specific sysctl to turn promiscuous  * from just promiscuous to wildly promiscuous...  *  * This driver also knows how to load the synthesizers in the 2.4 Gz  * ISA Half-card, Product number 847647476 (USA/FCC IEEE Channel set).  * This product consists of a "mothercard" that contains the 82586,  * NVRAM that holds the PSA, and the ISA-buss interface custom ASIC.   * The radio transceiver is a "daughtercard" called the WaveMODEM which  * connects to the mothercard through two single-inline connectors: a  * 20-pin connector provides DC-power and modem signals, and a 3-pin  * connector which exports the antenna connection. The code herein  * loads the receive and transmit synthesizers and the corresponding  * transmitter output power value from an EEPROM controlled through  * additional registers via the MMC. The EEPROM address selected  * are those whose values are preset by the DOS utility programs  * provided with the product, and this provides compatible operation  * with the DOS Packet Driver software. A future modification will  * add the necessary functionality to this driver and to the wlconfig  * utility to completely replace the DOS Configuration Utilities.  * The 2.4 Gz WaveMODEM is described in document number 407-024692/E,  * and is available through Lucent Technologies OEM supply channels.  * --RAB 1997/06/08.  */

As far as I can tell, the best break between this  *	routine and the attach code is to simply determine whether the board  *	is configured in properly.  Currently my approach to this is to write  *	and read a word from the SRAM on the board being probed.  If the word  *	comes back properly then we assume the board is there.  The config  *	code expects to see a successful return from the probe routine before  *	attach will be called.  *  * input	: address device is mapped to, and unit # being checked  * output	: a '1' is returned if the board exists, and a 0 otherwise  *  */

For simplicities sake, this  *	routine copies the receive buffers from the board into a local (stack)  *	buffer until the frame has been copied from the board.  Once in  *	the local buffer, the contents are copied to an mbuf chain that  *	is then enqueued onto the appropriate "if" queue.  *  * input	: board number, and a frame descriptor address  * output	: the packet is put into an mbuf chain, and passed up  * assumes	: if any errors occur, packet is "dropped on the floor"  *  */
