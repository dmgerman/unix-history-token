Michael Graff stripped out the Ethernet stuff  * and added HSSI stuff.  Basil Gunn ported it to Solaris (lost) and  * Rob Braun ported it to Linux.  Andrew Stanley-Jones added support  * for three more cards and wrote the first version of lmcconfig.  * During 2002-5 David Boggs rewrote it and now feels responsible for it.  *  * Responsible Individual:  *  * Send bug reports and improvements to<boggs@boggs.palo-alto.ca.us>.  */

comment|/* Tulip's hardware implementation of General Purpose IO  *   (GPIO) pins makes life difficult for software.  * Bits 7-0 in the Tulip GPIO CSR are used for two purposes  *   depending on the state of bit 8.  * If bit 8 is 0 then bits 7-0 are "data" bits.  * If bit 8 is 1 then bits 7-0 are "direction" bits.  * If a direction bit is one, the data bit is an output.  * The problem is that the direction bits are WRITE-ONLY.  * Software must remember the direction bits in a shadow copy.  * (sc->gpio_dir) in order to change some but not all of the bits.  * All accesses to the Tulip GPIO register use these five procedures.  */
