comment|/**  * @brief This method will attempt to discover the supplied domain.  *  * @warning This method must be synchronized with the controller completion  *          handler (see scic_controller_get_handler_methods()).  The user  *          may call this method from within the completion handler in which  *          case, no synchronization is necessary.  *  * @note  *        - IO requests from the OS driver are held off until discovery  *          of the domain is complete.  *        - Discovery may perform SSP or STP IO requests to configure  *          remote devices prior to informing the SCIF User of their  *          existence via the remote_device_ready user callback.  *  * @param[in]  domain This parameter specifies the framework domain object  *             on which to discover devices.  * @param[in]  discover_timeout This parameter specifies the number of  *             milliseconds in which the domain discovery operation should  *             complete.  * @param[in]  device_timeout This parameter specifies the number of  *             milliseconds in which the device configuration and/or reset  *             operations should complete.  Logically, the device_timeout  *             parameter should be shorter then the domain_timeout value.  *             Especially considering the domain could be made up of "n"  *             different devices.  *  * @return Indicate if the discover operation started successfully.  * @retval SCI_SUCCESS This value is returned if the discover operation  *         started successfully.  * @retval SCI_WARNING_TIMER_CONFLICT This value is returned if the SCI  *         implementation doesn't support the desired timeout amounts or if  *         the desired timeout amounts conflict in some manner.  */
