comment|/**  * @brief This method is called by the SCI user to construct all SCI Core  *        task management requests, regardless of protocol.  Memory  *        initialization and functionality common to all task request types  *        is performed in this method.  *  * @note  The SCI core implementation will create an association between  *        the user task request object and the core task request object.  *  * @param[in]  scic_controller the handle to the core controller object  *             for which to build the task managmement request.  * @param[in]  scic_remote_device the handle to the core remote device  *             object for which to build the task management request.  *             passed, then a copy of the request is built internally.  The  *             request will be copied into the actual controller request  *             memory when the task is allocated internally during the  *             scic_controller_start_task() method.  * @param[in]  io_tag This parameter specifies the IO tag to be associated  *             with this request.  If SCI_CONTROLLER_INVALID_IO_TAG is  *             passed, then a copy of the request is built internally.  The  *             request will be copied into the actual controller request  *             memory when the IO tag is allocated internally during the  *             scic_controller_start_io() method.  * @param[in]  user_task_request_object This parameter specifies the user  *             task request to be utilized during construction.  This task  *             pointer will become the associated object for the core  *             task request object.  * @param[in]  scic_task_request_memory This parameter specifies the memory  *             location to be utilized when building the core request.  * @param[out] new_scic_task_request_handle This parameter specifies a  *             pointer to the handle the core will expect in further  *             interactions with the core task request object.  *  * @return Indicate if the controller successfully built the task request.  * @retval SCI_SUCCESS This value is returned if the task request was  *         successfully built.  */
