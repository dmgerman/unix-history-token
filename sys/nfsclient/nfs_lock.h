comment|/*  * lockd uses the nfssvc system call to get the unique kernel services it needs.  * It passes in a request structure with a version number at the start.  * This prevents libc from needing to change if the information passed  * between lockd and the kernel needs to change.  *  * If a structure changes, you must bump the version number.  */
