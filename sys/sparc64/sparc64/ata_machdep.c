comment|/* 	 * The VTOC8 disk label only uses 16-bit fields for cylinders, heads 	 * and sectors so the geometry of large disks has to be adjusted. 	 * If the disk is> 32GB at 16 heads and 63 sectors, adjust to 255 	 * sectors (this matches what the OpenSolaris dad(7D) driver does). 	 * If the the disk is even> 128GB, additionally adjust the heads to 	 * 255.  This allows disks up to the 2TB limit of the extended VTOC8. 	 * XXX the OpenSolaris dad(7D) driver limits the mediasize to 128GB. 	 */
