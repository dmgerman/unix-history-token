comment|/* 	 * The VTOC8 disk label only uses 16-bit fields for cylinders, heads 	 * and sectors so the geometry of large disks has to be adjusted. 	 * We generally use the sizing used by cam_calc_geometry(9), except 	 * when it would overflow the cylinders, in which case we use 255 	 * heads and sectors.  This allows disks up to the 2TB limit of the 	 * extended VTOC8. 	 * XXX this doesn't match the sizing used by OpenSolaris, as that 	 * would exceed the 8-bit ccg->heads and ccg->secs_per_track. 	 */
