comment|/*  * We need a clock management system that works across unrelated SoCs and  * devices.  For now, to keep imx development moving, define some barebones  * functionality that can be shared within the imx family by having each SoC  * implement functions with a common name.  *  * The usb enable functions are best-effort.  They turn on the usb otg, host,  * and phy clocks in a SoC-specific manner, but it may take a lot more than that  * to make usb work on a given board.  In particular, it can require specific  * pinmux setup of gpio pins connected to external phy parts, voltage regulators  * and overcurrent detectors, and so on.  On such boards, u-boot or other early  * board setup code has to handle those things.  */
