comment|/*  * arm_irq_memory_barrier()  *  * Ensure all writes to device memory have reached devices before proceeding.  *  * This is intended to be called from the post-filter and post-thread routines  * of an interrupt controller implementation.  A peripheral device driver should  * use bus_space_barrier() if it needs to ensure a write has reached the  * hardware for some reason other than clearing interrupt conditions.  *  * The need for this function arises from the ARM weak memory ordering model.  * Writes to locations mapped with the Device attribute bypass any caches, but  * are buffered.  Multiple writes to the same device will be observed by that  * device in the order issued by the cpu.  Writes to different devices may  * appear at those devices in a different order than issued by the cpu.  That  * is, if the cpu writes to device A then device B, the write to device B could  * complete before the write to device A.  *  * Consider a typical device interrupt handler which services the interrupt and  * writes to a device status-acknowledge register to clear the interrupt before  * returning.  That write is posted to the L2 controller which "immediately"  * places it in a store buffer and automatically drains that buffer.  This can  * be less immediate than you'd think... There may be no free slots in the store  * buffers, so an existing buffer has to be drained first to make room.  The  * target bus may be busy with other traffic (such as DMA for various devices),  * delaying the drain of the store buffer for some indeterminate time.  While  * all this delay is happening, execution proceeds on the CPU, unwinding its way  * out of the interrupt call stack to the point where the interrupt driver code  * is ready to EOI and unmask the interrupt.  The interrupt controller may be  * accessed via a faster bus than the hardware whose handler just ran; the write  * to unmask and EOI the interrupt may complete quickly while the device write  * to ack and clear the interrupt source is still lingering in a store buffer  * waiting for access to a slower bus.  With the interrupt unmasked at the  * interrupt controller but still active at the device, as soon as interrupts  * are enabled on the core the device re-interrupts immediately: now you've got  * a spurious interrupt on your hands.  *  * The right way to fix this problem is for every device driver to use the  * proper bus_space_barrier() calls in its interrupt handler.  For ARM a single  * barrier call at the end of the handler would work.  This would have to be  * done to every driver in the system, not just arm-specific drivers.  *  * Another potential fix is to map all device memory as Strongly-Ordered rather  * than Device memory, which takes the store buffers out of the picture.  This  * has a pretty big impact on overall system performance, because each strongly  * ordered memory access causes all L2 store buffers to be drained.  *  * A compromise solution is to have the interrupt controller implementation call  * this function to establish a barrier between writes to the interrupt-source  * device and writes to the interrupt controller device.  *  * This takes the interrupt number as an argument, and currently doesn't use it.  * The plan is that maybe some day there is a way to flag certain interrupts as  * "memory barrier safe" and we can avoid this overhead with them.  */
