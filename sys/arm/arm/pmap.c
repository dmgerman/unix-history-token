EVEN IF 	 * WE'VE RECENTLY FIXED UP THE CORRESPONDING L1 in pmap_enter(), for 	 * example. 	 * 	 * This is extremely likely to happen if pmap_enter() updated the L1 	 * entry for a recently entered mapping. In this case, the TLB is 	 * flushed for the new mapping, but there may still be TLB entries for 	 * other mappings belonging to other processes in the 1MB range 	 * covered by the L1 entry. 	 * 	 * Since 'rv == 0', we know that the L1 already contains the correct 	 * value, so the fault must be due to a stale TLB entry. 	 * 	 * Since we always need to flush the TLB anyway in the case where we 	 * fixed up the L1, or frobbed the L2 PTE, we effectively deal with 	 * stale TLB entries dynamically. 	 * 	 * However, the above condition can ONLY happen if the current L1 is 	 * being shared.

It's used by  * pmap_copy_page, pmap_zero page and maybe some others later on.  *  * Its policy is effectively:  *  o If there are no mappings, we don't bother doing anything with the cache.  *  o If there is one mapping, we clean just that page.  *  o If there are multiple mappings, we clean the entire cache.  *  * So that some functions can be further optimised, it returns 0 if it didn't  * clean the entire cache, or 1 if it did.  *  * XXX One bug in this routine is that if the pv_entry has a single page  * mapped at 0x00000000 a whole cache clean will be performed rather than  * just the 1 page. Since this should not occur in everyday use and if it does  * it will just result in not the most efficient clean for the page.  */
