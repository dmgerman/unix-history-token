If the given address range isn't  * static-mapped, then ptov returns NULL and vtop returns DEVMAP_PADDR_NOTFOUND.  * The latter implies that you can't vtop just the last byte of physical address  * space.  This is not as limiting as it might sound, because even if a device  * occupies the end of the physical address space, you're only prevented from  * doing vtop for that single byte.  If you vtop a size bigger than 1 it works.  */
