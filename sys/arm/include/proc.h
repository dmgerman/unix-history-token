comment|/*  * This holds the syscall state for a single system call.  * As some syscall arguments may be 64-bit aligned we need to ensure the  * args value is 64-bit aligned. The ABI will then ensure any 64-bit  * arguments are already correctly aligned, even if they were passed in  * via registers, we just need to make sure we copy them to an aligned  * buffer.  */
