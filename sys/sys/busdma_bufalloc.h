comment|/*  * Create an allocator that manages a pool of DMA buffers.  *  * The allocator manages a collection of uma(9) zones of buffers in power-of-two  * sized increments ranging from minimum_alignment to the platform's PAGE_SIZE.  * The buffers within each zone are aligned on boundaries corresponding to the  * buffer size, and thus by implication each buffer is contiguous within a page  * and does not cross a power of two boundary larger than the buffer size.  * These rules are intended to make it easy for a busdma implementation to  * check whether a tag's constraints allow use of a buffer from the allocator.  *  * minimum_alignment is also the minimum buffer allocation size.  For platforms  * with software-assisted cache coherency, this is typically the data cache line  * size (and MUST not be smaller than the cache line size).  *  * name appears in zone stats as 'dma name nnnnn' where 'dma' is fixed and  * 'nnnnn' is the size of buffers in that zone.  *  * If if the alloc/free function pointers are NULL, the regular uma internal  * allocators are used (I.E., you get "plain old kernel memory").  On a platform  * with an exclusion zone that applies to all DMA operations, a custom allocator  * could be used to ensure no buffer memory is ever allocated from that zone,  * allowing the bus_dmamem_alloc() implementation to make the assumption that  * buffers provided by the allocation could never lead to the need for a bounce.  */
