comment|/*  * Definition for the 'struct label' in-kernel MAC label data structure.  * In general, struct label pointers are embedded in kernel data structures  * representing objects that may be labeled (and protected).  It is not  * directly embedded in order to avoid encoding this definition into modules  * unnecessarily.  Currently, only the MAC Framework and MAC policy modules  * dereference this data structure.  In the future, we would like struct  * label to also be opaque to policies.  Each policy requesting a label slot  * can store one long or void pointer in their slot.  *  * XXXMAC: This shouldn't be exported to userland, but is because of ucred.h  * and various other messes.  */
