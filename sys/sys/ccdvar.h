comment|/*  * Interleave description table.  * Computed at boot time to speed irregular-interleave lookups.  * The idea is that we interleave in "groups".  First we interleave  * evenly over all component disks up to the size of the smallest  * component (the first group), then we interleave evenly over all  * remaining disks up to the size of the next-smallest (second group),  * and so on.  *  * Each table entry describes the interleave characteristics of one  * of these groups.  For example if a concatenated disk consisted of  * three components of 5, 3, and 7 DEV_BSIZE blocks interleaved at  * DEV_BSIZE (1), the table would have three entries:  *  *	ndisk	startblk	startoff	dev  *	3	0		0		0, 1, 2  *	2	9		3		0, 2  *	1	13		5		2  *	0	-		-		-  *  * which says that the first nine blocks (0-8) are interleaved over  * 3 disks (0, 1, 2) starting at block offset 0 on any component disk,  * the next 4 blocks (9-12) are interleaved over 2 disks (0, 2) starting  * at component block 3, and the remaining blocks (13-14) are on disk  * 2 starting at offset 5.  */
