comment|/*  * External authenticator placeholder module.  *  * This support is optional; it is only used when the 802.11 layer's  * authentication mode is set to use 802.1x or WPA is enabled separately  * (for WPA-PSK).  If compiled as a module this code does not need  * to be present unless 802.1x/WPA is in use.  *  * The authenticator hooks into the 802.11 layer.  At present we use none  * of the available callbacks--the user mode authenticator process works  * entirely from messages about stations joining and leaving.  */
