comment|/*  * SWB_NPAGES can be set to any value from 1 to 16 pages per allocation,  * however, due to the allocation spilling into non-swap pager backed memory,  * suggest keeping SWB_NPAGES small (1-4).  If high performance is mandatory  * perhaps up to 8 pages might be in order????  * Above problem has been fixed, now we support 16 pages per block.  Unused  * space is recovered by the swap pager now...  */
