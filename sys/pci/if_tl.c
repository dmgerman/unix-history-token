comment|/*  * Some notes about the ThunderLAN:  *  * The ThunderLAN controller is a single chip containing PCI controller  * logic, approximately 3K of on-board SRAM, a LAN controller, and media  * independent interface (MII) bus. The MII allows the ThunderLAN chip to  * control up to 32 different physical interfaces (PHYs). The ThunderLAN  * also has a built-in 10baseT PHY, allowing a single ThunderLAN controller  * to act as a complete ethernet interface.  *  * Other PHYs may be attached to the ThunderLAN; the Compaq 10/100 cards  * use a National Semiconductor DP83840A PHY that supports 10 or 100Mb/sec  * in full or half duplex. Some of the Compaq Deskpro machines use a  * Level 1 LXT970 PHY with the same capabilities. Certain Olicom adapters  * use a Micro Linear ML6692 100BaseTX only PHY, which can be used in  * concert with the ThunderLAN's internal PHY to provide full 10/100  * support. This is cheaper than using a standalone external PHY for both  * 10/100 modes and letting the ThunderLAN's internal PHY go to waste.  * A serial EEPROM is also attached to the ThunderLAN chip to provide  * power-up default register settings and for storing the adapter's  * station address. Although not supported by this driver, the ThunderLAN  * chip can also be connected to token ring PHYs.  *  * The ThunderLAN has a set of registers which can be used to issue  * commands, acknowledge interrupts, and to manipulate other internal  * registers on its DIO bus. The primary registers can be accessed  * using either programmed I/O (inb/outb) or via PCI memory mapping,  * depending on how the card is configured during the PCI probing  * phase. It is even possible to have both PIO and memory mapped  * access turned on at the same time.  *   * Frame reception and transmission with the ThunderLAN chip is done  * using frame 'lists.' A list structure looks more or less like this:  *  * struct tl_frag {  *	u_int32_t		fragment_address;  *	u_int32_t		fragment_size;  * };  * struct tl_list {  *	u_int32_t		forward_pointer;  *	u_int16_t		cstat;  *	u_int16_t		frame_size;  *	struct tl_frag		fragments[10];  * };  *  * The forward pointer in the list header can be either a 0 or the address  * of another list, which allows several lists to be linked together. Each  * list contains up to 10 fragment descriptors. This means the chip allows  * ethernet frames to be broken up into up to 10 chunks for transfer to  * and from the SRAM. Note that the forward pointer and fragment buffer  * addresses are physical memory addresses, not virtual. Note also that  * a single ethernet frame can not span lists: if the host wants to  * transmit a frame and the frame data is split up over more than 10  * buffers, the frame has to collapsed before it can be transmitted.  *  * To receive frames, the driver sets up a number of lists and populates  * the fragment descriptors, then it sends an RX GO command to the chip.  * When a frame is received, the chip will DMA it into the memory regions  * specified by the fragment descriptors and then trigger an RX 'end of  * frame interrupt' when done. The driver may choose to use only one  * fragment per list; this may result is slighltly less efficient use  * of memory in exchange for improving performance.  *  * To transmit frames, the driver again sets up lists and fragment  * descriptors, only this time the buffers contain frame data that  * is to be DMA'ed into the chip instead of out of it. Once the chip  * has transfered the data into its on-board SRAM, it will trigger a  * TX 'end of frame' interrupt. It will also generate an 'end of channel'  * interrupt when it reaches the end of the list.  */

comment|/*  * Some notes about this driver:  *  * The ThunderLAN chip provides a couple of different ways to organize  * reception, transmission and interrupt handling. The simplest approach  * is to use one list each for transmission and reception. In this mode,  * the ThunderLAN will generate two interrupts for every received frame  * (one RX EOF and one RX EOC) and two for each transmitted frame (one  * TX EOF and one TX EOC). This may make the driver simpler but it hurts  * performance to have to handle so many interrupts.  *  * Initially I wanted to create a circular list of receive buffers so  * that the ThunderLAN chip would think there was an infinitely long  * receive channel and never deliver an RXEOC interrupt. However this  * doesn't work correctly under heavy load: while the manual says the  * chip will trigger an RXEOF interrupt each time a frame is copied into  * memory, you can't count on the chip waiting around for you to acknowledge  * the interrupt before it starts trying to DMA the next frame. The result  * is that the chip might traverse the entire circular list and then wrap  * around before you have a chance to do anything about it. Consequently,  * the receive list is terminated (with a 0 in the forward pointer in the  * last element). Each time an RXEOF interrupt arrives, the used list  * is shifted to the end of the list. This gives the appearance of an  * infinitely large RX chain so long as the driver doesn't fall behind  * the chip and allow all of the lists to be filled up.  *  * If all the lists are filled, the adapter will deliver an RX 'end of  * channel' interrupt when it hits the 0 forward pointer at the end of  * the chain. The RXEOC handler then cleans out the RX chain and resets  * the list head pointer in the ch_parm register and restarts the receiver.  *  * For frame transmission, it is possible to program the ThunderLAN's  * transmit interrupt threshold so that the chip can acknowledge multiple  * lists with only a single TX EOF interrupt. This allows the driver to  * queue several frames in one shot, and only have to handle a total  * two interrupts (one TX EOF and one TX EOC) no matter how many frames  * are transmitted. Frame transmission is done directly out of the  * mbufs passed to the tl_start() routine via the interface send queue.  * The driver simply sets up the fragment descriptors in the transmit  * lists to point to the mbuf data regions and sends a TX GO command.  *  * Note that since the RX and TX lists themselves are always used  * only by the driver, the are malloc()ed once at driver initialization  * time and never free()ed.  *  * Also, in order to remain as platform independent as possible, this  * driver uses memory mapped register access to manipulate the card  * as opposed to programmed I/O. This avoids the use of the inb/outb  * (and related) instructions which are specific to the i386 platform.  *  * Using these techniques, this driver achieves very high performance  * by minimizing the amount of interrupts generated during large  * transfers and by completely avoiding buffer copies. Frame transfer  * to and from the ThunderLAN chip is performed entirely by the chip  * itself thereby reducing the load on the host CPU.  */

We want to arrange for 224.0.0.1 (the "all hosts")  * group to always be in the perfect filter, but as more groups are added,  * the 224.0.0.1 entry (which is always added first) gets pushed down  * the list and ends up at the tail. So after 3 or 4 multicast groups  * are added, the all-hosts entry gets pushed out of the perfect filter  * and into the hash table.  *  * Because the multicast list is a doubly-linked list as opposed to a  * circular queue, we don't have the ability to just grab the tail of  * the list and traverse it backwards. Instead, we have to traverse  * the list once to find the tail, then traverse it again backwards to  * update the multicast filter.  */

comment|/*  * Interrupt handler for RX 'end of frame' condition (EOF). This  * tells us that a full ethernet frame has been captured and we need  * to handle it.  *  * Reception is done using 'lists' which consist of a header and a  * series of 10 data count/data address pairs that point to buffers.  * Initially you're supposed to create a list, populate it with pointers  * to buffers, then load the physical address of the list into the  * ch_parm register. The adapter is then supposed to DMA the received  * frame into the buffers for you.  *  * To make things as fast as possible, we have the chip DMA directly  * into mbufs. This saves us from having to do a buffer copy: we can  * just hand the mbufs directly to ether_input(). Once the frame has  * been sent on its way, the 'list' structure is assigned a new buffer  * and moved to the end of the RX chain. As long we we stay ahead of  * the chip, it will always think it has an endless receive channel.  *  * If we happen to fall behind and the chip manages to fill up all of  * the buffers, it will generate an end of channel interrupt and wait  * for us to empty the chain and restart the receiver.  */

The adapter triggers this  * interrupt to tell us it hit the end of the current transmit list.  *  * A note about this: it's possible for a condition to arise where  * tl_start() may try to send frames between TXEOF and TXEOC interrupts.  * You have to avoid this since the chip expects things to go in a  * particular order: transmit, acknowledge TXEOF, acknowledge TXEOC.  * When the TXEOF handler is called, it will free all of the transmitted  * frames and reset the tx_head pointer to NULL. However, a TXEOC  * interrupt should be received and acknowledged before any more frames  * are queued for transmission. If tl_statrt() is called after TXEOF  * resets the tx_head pointer but _before_ the TXEOC interrupt arrives,  * it could attempt to issue a transmit command prematurely.  *  * To guard against this, tl_start() will only issue transmit commands  * if the tl_txeoc flag is set, and only the TXEOC interrupt handler  * can set this flag once tl_start() has cleared it.  */
