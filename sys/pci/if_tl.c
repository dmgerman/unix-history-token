comment|/*  * Some notes about the ThunderLAN:  *  * The ThunderLAN controller is a single chip containing PCI controller  * logic, approximately 3K of on-board SRAM, a LAN controller, and media  * independent interface (MII) bus. The MII allows the ThunderLAN chip to  * control up to 32 different physical interfaces (PHYs). The ThunderLAN  * also has a built-in 10baseT PHY, allowing a single ThunderLAN controller  * to act as a complete ethernet interface.  *  * Other PHYs may be attached to the ThunderLAN; the Compaq 10/100 cards  * use a National Semiconductor DP83840A PHY that supports 10 or 100Mb/sec  * in full or half duplex. Some of the Compaq Deskpro machines use a  * Level 1 LXT970 PHY with the same capabilities. Certain Olicom adapters  * use a Micro Linear ML6692 100BaseTX only PHY, which can be used in  * concert with the ThunderLAN's internal PHY to provide full 10/100  * support. This is cheaper than using a standalone external PHY for both  * 10/100 modes and letting the ThunderLAN's internal PHY go to waste.  * A serial EEPROM is also attached to the ThunderLAN chip to provide  * power-up default register settings and for storing the adapter's  * station address. Although not supported by this driver, the ThunderLAN  * chip can also be connected to token ring PHYs.  *  * The ThunderLAN has a set of registers which can be used to issue  * commands, acknowledge interrupts, and to manipulate other internal  * registers on its DIO bus. The primary registers can be accessed  * using either programmed I/O (inb/outb) or via PCI memory mapping,  * depending on how the card is configured during the PCI probing  * phase. It is even possible to have both PIO and memory mapped  * access turned on at the same time.  *   * Frame reception and transmission with the ThunderLAN chip is done  * using frame 'lists.' A list structure looks more or less like this:  *  * struct tl_frag {  *	u_int32_t		fragment_address;  *	u_int32_t		fragment_size;  * };  * struct tl_list {  *	u_int32_t		forward_pointer;  *	u_int16_t		cstat;  *	u_int16_t		frame_size;  *	struct tl_frag		fragments[10];  * };  *  * The forward pointer in the list header can be either a 0 or the address  * of another list, which allows several lists to be linked together. Each  * list contains up to 10 fragment descriptors. This means the chip allows  * ethernet frames to be broken up into up to 10 chunks for transfer to  * and from the SRAM. Note that the forward pointer and fragment buffer  * addresses are physical memory addresses, not virtual. Note also that  * a single ethernet frame can not span lists: if the host wants to  * transmit a frame and the frame data is split up over more than 10  * buffers, the frame has to collapsed before it can be transmitted.  *  * To receive frames, the driver sets up a number of lists and populates  * the fragment descriptors, then it sends an RX GO command to the chip.  * When a frame is received, the chip will DMA it into the memory regions  * specified by the fragment descriptors and then trigger an RX 'end of  * frame interrupt' when done. The driver may choose to use only one  * fragment per list; this may result is slighltly less efficient use  * of memory in exchange for improving performance.  *  * To transmit frames, the driver again sets up lists and fragment  * descriptors, only this time the buffers contain frame data that  * is to be DMA'ed into the chip instead of out of it. Once the chip  * has transfered the data into its on-board SRAM, it will trigger a  * TX 'end of frame' interrupt. It will also generate an 'end of channel'  * interrupt when it reaches the end of the list.  */

comment|/*  * Some notes about this driver:  *  * The ThunderLAN chip provides a couple of different ways to organize  * reception, transmission and interrupt handling. The simplest approach  * is to use one list each for transmission and reception. In this mode,  * the ThunderLAN will generate two interrupts for every received frame  * (one RX EOF and one RX EOC) and two for each transmitted frame (one  * TX EOF and one TX EOC). This may make the driver simpler but it hurts  * performance to have to handle so many interrupts.  *  * Initially I wanted to create a circular list of receive buffers so  * that the ThunderLAN chip would think there was an infinitely long  * receive channel and never deliver an RXEOC interrupt. However this  * doesn't work correctly under heavy load: while the manual says the  * chip will trigger an RXEOF interrupt each time a frame is copied into  * memory, you can't count on the chip waiting around for you to acknowledge  * the interrupt before it starts trying to DMA the next frame. The result  * is that the chip might traverse the entire circular list and then wrap  * around before you have a chance to do anything about it. Consequently,  * the receive list is terminated (with a 0 in the forward pointer in the  * last element). Each time an RXEOF interrupt arrives, the used list  * is shifted to the end of the list. This gives the appearance of an  * infinitely large RX chain so long as the driver doesn't fall behind  * the chip and allow all of the lists to be filled up.  *  * If all the lists are filled, the adapter will deliver an RX 'end of  * channel' interrupt when it hits the 0 forward pointer at the end of  * the chain. The RXEOC handler then cleans out the RX chain and resets  * the list head pointer in the ch_parm register and restarts the receiver.  *  * For frame transmission, it is possible to program the ThunderLAN's  * transmit interrupt threshold so that the chip can acknowledge multiple  * lists with only a single TX EOF interrupt. This allows the driver to  * queue several frames in one shot, and only have to handle a total  * two interrupts (one TX EOF and one TX EOC) no matter how many frames  * are transmitted. Frame transmission is done directly out of the  * mbufs passed to the tl_start() routine via the interface send queue.  * The driver simply sets up the fragment descriptors in the transmit  * lists to point to the mbuf data regions and sends a TX GO command.  *  * Note that since the RX and TX lists themselves are always used  * only by the driver, the are malloc()ed once at driver initialization  * time and never free()ed.  *  * Also, in order to remain as platform independent as possible, this  * driver uses memory mapped register access to manipulate the card  * as opposed to programmed I/O. This avoids the use of the inb/outb  * (and related) instructions which are specific to the i386 platform.  *  * Using these techniques, this driver achieves very high performance  * by minimizing the amount of interrupts generated during large  * transfers and by completely avoiding buffer copies. Frame transfer  * to and from the ThunderLAN chip is performed entirely by the chip  * itself thereby reducing the load on the host CPU.  */

comment|/*  * Initiate autonegotiation with a link partner.  *  * Note that the Texas Instruments ThunderLAN programmer's guide  * fails to mention one very important point about autonegotiation.  * Autonegotiation is done largely by the PHY, independent of the  * ThunderLAN chip itself: the PHY sets the flags in the BMCR  * register to indicate what modes were selected and if link status  * is good. In fact, the PHY does pretty much all of the work itself,  * except for one small detail.  *  * The PHY may negotiate a full-duplex of half-duplex link, and set  * the PHY_BMCR_DUPLEX bit accordingly, but the ThunderLAN's 'NetCommand'  * register _also_ has a half-duplex/full-duplex bit, and you MUST ALSO  * SET THIS BIT MANUALLY TO CORRESPOND TO THE MODE SELECTED FOR THE PHY!  * In other words, both the ThunderLAN chip and the PHY have to be  * programmed for full-duplex mode in order for full-duplex to actually  * work. So in order for autonegotiation to really work right, we have  * to wait for the link to come up, check the BMCR register, then set  * the ThunderLAN for full or half-duplex as needed.  *  * I struggled for two days to figure this out, so I'm making a point  * of drawing attention to this fact. I think it's very strange that  * the ThunderLAN doesn't automagically track the duplex state of the  * PHY, but there you have it.  *  * Also when, using a National Semiconductor DP83840A PHY, we have to  * allow a full three seconds for autonegotiation to complete. So what  * we do is flip the autonegotiation restart bit, then set a timeout  * to wake us up in three seconds to check the link state.  *  * Note that there are some versions of the Olicom 2326 that use a  * Micro Linear ML6692 100BaseTX PHY. This particular PHY is designed  * to provide 100BaseTX support only, but can be used with a controller  * that supports an internal 10Mbps PHY to provide a complete  * 10/100Mbps solution. However, the ML6692 does not have vendor and  * device ID registers, and hence always shows up with a vendor/device  * ID of 0.  *  * We detect this configuration by checking the phy vendor ID in the  * softc structure. If it's a zero, and we're negotiating a high-speed  * mode, then we turn off the internal PHY. If it's a zero and we've  * negotiated a high-speed mode, we turn on the internal PHY. Note  * that to make things even more fun, we have to make extra sure that  * the loopback bit in the internal PHY's control register is turned  * off.  */

comment|/*  * Interrupt handler for RX 'end of frame' condition (EOF). This  * tells us that a full ethernet frame has been captured and we need  * to handle it.  *  * Reception is done using 'lists' which consist of a header and a  * series of 10 data count/data address pairs that point to buffers.  * Initially you're supposed to create a list, populate it with pointers  * to buffers, then load the physical address of the list into the  * ch_parm register. The adapter is then supposed to DMA the received  * frame into the buffers for you.  *  * To make things as fast as possible, we have the chip DMA directly  * into mbufs. This saves us from having to do a buffer copy: we can  * just hand the mbufs directly to ether_input(). Once the frame has  * been sent on its way, the 'list' structure is assigned a new buffer  * and moved to the end of the RX chain. As long we we stay ahead of  * the chip, it will always think it has an endless receive channel.  *  * If we happen to fall behind and the chip manages to fill up all of  * the buffers, it will generate an end of channel interrupt and wait  * for us to empty the chain and restart the receiver.  */

However, a TXEOC  * interrupt should be received and acknowledged before any more frames  * are queued for transmission. If tl_statrt() is called after TXEOF  * resets the tx_head pointer but _before_ the TXEOC interrupt arrives,  * it could attempt to issue a transmit command prematurely.  *  * To guard against this, tl_start() will only issue transmit commands  * if the tl_txeoc flag is set, and only the TXEOC interrupt handler  * can set this flag once tl_start() has cleared it.  */
