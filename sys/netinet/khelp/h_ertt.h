comment|/*  * The ERTT (Enhanced Round Trip Time) Khelp module calculates an estimate of  * the instantaneous TCP RTT which, for example, is used by delay-based  * congestion control schemes. When the module is loaded, ERTT data is  * calculated for each active TCP connection and encapsulated within a  * "struct ertt".  *  * This software was first released in 2010 by David Hayes and Lawrence Stewart  * whilst working on the NewTCP research project at Swinburne University's  * Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures, Melbourne, Australia, which was  * made possible in part by a grant from the Cisco University Research Program  * Fund at Community Foundation Silicon Valley. Testing and development was  * further assisted by a grant from the FreeBSD Foundation. More details are  * available at:  *   http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/newtcp/  */
