comment|/* Format of GDB symbol table data.    There is one symbol segment for each source file or    independant compilation.  These segments are simply concatenated    to form the GDB symbol table.  A zero word where the beginning    of a segment is expected indicates there are no more segments.  Format of a symbol segment:     The symbol segment begins with a word containing 1    if it is in the format described here.  Other formats may    be designed, with other code numbers.     The segment contains many objects which point at each other.    The pointers are offsets in bytes from the beginning of the segment.    Thus, each segment can be loaded into core and its pointers relocated    to make valid in-core pointers.     All the data objects in the segment can be found indirectly from    one of them, the root object, of type `struct symbol_root'.    It appears at the beginning of the segment.     The total size of the segment, in bytes, appears as the `length'    field of this object.  This size includes the size of the    root object.     All the object data types are defined here to contain pointer types    appropriate for in-core use on a relocated symbol segment.    Casts to and from type int are required for working with    unrelocated symbol segments such as are found in the file.     The ldsymaddr word is filled in by the loader to contain    the offset (in bytes) within the ld symbol table    of the first nonglobal symbol from this compilation.    This makes it possible to match those symbols    (which contain line number information) reliably with    the segment they go with.     Core addresses within the program that appear in the symbol segment    are not relocated by the loader.  They are inserted by the assembler    and apply to addresses as output by the assembler, so GDB must    relocate them when it loads the symbol segment.  It gets the information    on how to relocate from the textrel, datarel, bssrel, databeg and bssbeg    words of the root object.     The words textrel, datarel and bssrel    are filled in by ld with the amounts to relocate within-the-file    text, data and bss addresses by; databeg and bssbeg can be    used to tell which kind of relocation an address needs.  */

comment|/* All of the name-scope contours of the program    are represented by `struct block' objects.    All of these objects are pointed to by the blockvector.     Each block represents one name scope.    Each lexical context has its own block.     The first two blocks in the blockvector are special.    The first one contains all the symbols defined in this compilation    whose scope is the entire program linked together.    The second one contains all the symbols whose scope is the    entire compilation excluding other separate compilations.    In C, these correspond to global symbols and static symbols.     Each block records a range of core addresses for the code that    is in the scope of the block.  The first two special blocks    give, for the range of code, the entire range of code produced    by the compilation that the symbol segment belongs to.     The blocks appear in the blockvector    in order of increasing starting-address,    and, within that, in order of decreasing ending-address.     This implies that within the body of one function    the blocks appear in the order of a depth-first tree walk.  */

In C, this contains variables, function names, typedef names    and enum type values.     STRUCT_NAMESPACE is used in C to hold struct, union and enum type names.    Thus, if `struct foo' is used in a C program,    it produces a symbol named `foo' in the STRUCT_NAMESPACE.
