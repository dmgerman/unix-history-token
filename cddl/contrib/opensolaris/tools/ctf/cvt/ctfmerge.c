comment|/*  * Given several files containing CTF data, merge and uniquify that data into  * a single CTF section in an output file.  *  * Merges can proceed independently.  As such, we perform the merges in parallel  * using a worker thread model.  A given glob of CTF data (either all of the CTF  * data from a single input file, or the result of one or more merges) can only  * be involved in a single merge at any given time, so the process decreases in  * parallelism, especially towards the end, as more and more files are  * consolidated, finally resulting in a single merge of two large CTF graphs.  * Unfortunately, the last merge is also the slowest, as the two graphs being  * merged are each the product of merges of half of the input files.  *  * The algorithm consists of two phases, described in detail below.  The first  * phase entails the merging of CTF data in groups of eight.  The second phase  * takes the results of Phase I, and merges them two at a time.  This disparity  * is due to an observation that the merge time increases at least quadratically  * with the size of the CTF data being merged.  As such, merges of CTF graphs  * newly read from input files are much faster than merges of CTF graphs that  * are themselves the results of prior merges.  *  * A further complication is the need to ensure the repeatability of CTF merges.  * That is, a merge should produce the same output every time, given the same  * input.  In both phases, this consistency requirement is met by imposing an  * ordering on the merge process, thus ensuring that a given set of input files  * are merged in the same order every time.  *  *   Phase I  *  *   The main thread reads the input files one by one, transforming the CTF  *   data they contain into tdata structures.  When a given file has been read  *   and parsed, it is placed on the work queue for retrieval by worker threads.  *  *   Central to Phase I is the Work In Progress (wip) array, which is used to  *   merge batches of files in a predictable order.  Files are read by the main  *   thread, and are merged into wip array elements in round-robin order.  When  *   the number of files merged into a given array slot equals the batch size,  *   the merged CTF graph in that array is added to the done slot in order by  *   array slot.  *  *   For example, consider a case where we have five input files, a batch size  *   of two, a wip array size of two, and two worker threads (T1 and T2).  *  *    1. The wip array elements are assigned initial batch numbers 0 and 1.  *    2. T1 reads an input file from the input queue (wq_queue).  This is the  *       first input file, so it is placed into wip[0].  The second file is  *       similarly read and placed into wip[1].  The wip array slots now contain  *       one file each (wip_nmerged == 1).  *    3. T1 reads the third input file, which it merges into wip[0].  The  *       number of files in wip[0] is equal to the batch size.  *    4. T2 reads the fourth input file, which it merges into wip[1].  wip[1]  *       is now full too.  *    5. T2 attempts to place the contents of wip[1] on the done queue  *       (wq_done_queue), but it can't, since the batch ID for wip[1] is 1.  *       Batch 0 needs to be on the done queue before batch 1 can be added, so  *       T2 blocks on wip[1]'s cv.  *    6. T1 attempts to place the contents of wip[0] on the done queue, and  *       succeeds, updating wq_lastdonebatch to 0.  It clears wip[0], and sets  *       its batch ID to 2.  T1 then signals wip[1]'s cv to awaken T2.  *    7. T2 wakes up, notices that wq_lastdonebatch is 0, which means that  *       batch 1 can now be added.  It adds wip[1] to the done queue, clears  *       wip[1], and sets its batch ID to 3.  It signals wip[0]'s cv, and  *       restarts.  *  *   The above process continues until all input files have been consumed.  At  *   this point, a pair of barriers are used to allow a single thread to move  *   any partial batches from the wip array to the done array in batch ID order.  *   When this is complete, wq_done_queue is moved to wq_queue, and Phase II  *   begins.  *  *	Locking Semantics (Phase I)  *  *	The input queue (wq_queue) and the done queue (wq_done_queue) are  *	protected by separate mutexes - wq_queue_lock and wq_done_queue.  wip  *	array slots are protected by their own mutexes, which must be grabbed  *	before releasing the input queue lock.  The wip array lock is dropped  *	when the thread restarts the loop.  If the array slot was full, the  *	array lock will be held while the slot contents are added to the done  *	queue.  The done queue lock is used to protect the wip slot cv's.  *  *	The pow number is protected by the queue lock.  The master batch ID  *	and last completed batch (wq_lastdonebatch) counters are protected *in  *	Phase I* by the done queue lock.  *  *   Phase II  *  *   When Phase II begins, the queue consists of the merged batches from the  *   first phase.  Assume we have five batches:  *  *	Q:	a b c d e  *  *   Using the same batch ID mechanism we used in Phase I, but without the wip  *   array, worker threads remove two entries at a time from the beginning of  *   the queue.  These two entries are merged, and are added back to the tail  *   of the queue, as follows:  *  *	Q:	a b c d e	# start  *	Q:	c d e ab	# a, b removed, merged, added to end  *	Q:	e ab cd		# c, d removed, merged, added to end  *	Q:	cd eab		# e, ab removed, merged, added to end  *	Q:	cdeab		# cd, eab removed, merged, added to end  *  *   When one entry remains on the queue, with no merges outstanding, Phase II  *   finishes.  We pre-determine the stopping point by pre-calculating the  *   number of nodes that will appear on the list.  In the example above, the  *   number (wq_ninqueue) is 9.  When ninqueue is 1, we conclude Phase II by  *   signaling the main thread via wq_done_cv.  *  *	Locking Semantics (Phase II)  *  *	The queue (wq_queue), ninqueue, and the master batch ID and last  *	completed batch counters are protected by wq_queue_lock.  The done  *	queue and corresponding lock are unused in Phase II as is the wip array.  *  *   Uniquification  *  *   We want the CTF data that goes into a given module to be as small as  *   possible.  For example, we don't want it to contain any type data that may  *   be present in another common module.  As such, after creating the master  *   tdata_t for a given module, we can, if requested by the user, uniquify it  *   against the tdata_t from another module (genunix in the case of the SunOS  *   kernel).  We perform a merge between the tdata_t for this module and the  *   tdata_t from genunix.  Nodes found in this module that are not present in  *   genunix are added to a third tdata_t - the uniquified tdata_t.  *  *   Additive Merges  *  *   In some cases, for example if we are issuing a new version of a common  *   module in a patch, we need to make sure that the CTF data already present  *   in that module does not change.  Changes to this data would void the CTF  *   data in any module that uniquified against the common module.  To preserve  *   the existing data, we can perform what is known as an additive merge.  In  *   this case, a final uniquification is performed against the CTF data in the  *   previous version of the module.  The result will be the placement of new  *   and changed data after the existing data, thus preserving the existing type  *   ID space.  *  *   Saving the result  *  *   When the merges are complete, the resulting tdata_t is placed into the  *   output file, replacing the .SUNW_ctf section (if any) already in that file.  *  * The person who changes the merging thread code in this file without updating  * this comment will not live to see the stock hit five.  */

comment|/*  * This program is intended to be invoked from a Makefile, as part of the build.  * As such, in the event of a failure or user-initiated interrupt (^C), we need  * to ensure that a subsequent re-make will cause ctfmerge to be executed again.  * Unfortunately, ctfmerge will usually be invoked directly after (and as part  * of the same Makefile rule as) a link, and will operate on the linked file  * in place.  If we merely exit upon receipt of a SIGINT, a subsequent make  * will notice that the *linked* file is newer than the object files, and thus  * will not reinvoke ctfmerge.  The only way to ensure that a subsequent make  * reinvokes ctfmerge, is to remove the file to which we are adding CTF  * data (confusingly named the output file).  This means that the link will need  * to happen again, but links are generally fast, and we can't allow the merge  * to be skipped.  *  * Another possibility would be to block SIGINT entirely - to always run to  * completion.  The run time of ctfmerge can, however, be measured in minutes  * in some cases, so this is not a valid option.  */
