comment|/* Coverage information is held in two files.  A notes file, which is    generated by the compiler, and a data file, which is generated    by the program under test.  Both files use a similar structure.  We    do not attempt to make these files backwards compatible with    previous versions, as you only need coverage information when    developing a program.  We do hold version information, so that    mismatches can be detected, and we use a format that allows tools    to skip information they do not understand or are not interested    in.     Numbers are recorded in the 32 bit unsigned binary form of the    endianness of the machine generating the file. 64 bit numbers are    stored as two 32 bit numbers, the low part first.  Strings are    padded with 1 to 4 NUL bytes, to bring the length up to a multiple    of 4. The number of 4 bytes is stored, followed by the padded    string. Zero length and NULL strings are simply stored as    a length of zero (they have no trailing NUL or padding).     	int32:  byte3 byte2 byte1 byte0 | byte0 byte1 byte2 byte3 	int64:  int32:low int32:high 	string: int32:0 | int32:length char* char:0 padding 	padding: | char:0 | char:0 char:0 | char:0 char:0 char:0 	item: int32 | int64 | string     The basic format of the files is     	file : int32:magic int32:version int32:stamp record*     The magic ident is different for the notes and the data files.  The    magic ident is used to determine the endianness of the file, when    reading.  The version is the same for both files and is derived    from gcc's version number. The stamp value is used to synchronize    note and data files and to synchronize merging within a data    file. It need not be an absolute time stamp, merely a ticker that    increments fast enough and cycles slow enough to distinguish    different compile/run/compile cycles.        Although the ident and version are formally 32 bit numbers, they    are derived from 4 character ASCII strings.  The version number    consists of the single character major version number, a two    character minor version number (leading zero for versions less than    10), and a single character indicating the status of the release.    That will be 'e' experimental, 'p' prerelease and 'r' for release.    Because, by good fortune, these are in alphabetical order, string    collating can be used to compare version strings.  Be aware that    the 'e' designation will (naturally) be unstable and might be    incompatible with itself.  For gcc 3.4 experimental, it would be    '304e' (0x33303465).  When the major version reaches 10, the    letters A-Z will be used.  Assuming minor increments releases every    6 months, we have to make a major increment every 50 years.    Assuming major increments releases every 5 years, we're ok for the    next 155 years -- good enough for me.     A record has a tag, length and variable amount of data.     	record: header data 	header: int32:tag int32:length 	data: item*     Records are not nested, but there is a record hierarchy.  Tag    numbers reflect this hierarchy.  Tags are unique across note and    data files.  Some record types have a varying amount of data.  The    LENGTH is the number of 4bytes that follow and is usually used to    determine how much data.  The tag value is split into 4 8-bit    fields, one for each of four possible levels.  The most significant    is allocated first.  Unused levels are zero.  Active levels are    odd-valued, so that the LSB of the level is one.  A sub-level    incorporates the values of its superlevels.  This formatting allows    you to determine the tag hierarchy, without understanding the tags    themselves, and is similar to the standard section numbering used    in technical documents.  Level values [1..3f] are used for common    tags, values [41..9f] for the notes file and [a1..ff] for the data    file.     The basic block graph file contains the following records    	note: unit function-graph* 	unit: header int32:checksum string:source 	function-graph: announce_function basic_blocks {arcs | lines}* 	announce_function: header int32:ident int32:checksum 		string:name string:source int32:lineno 	basic_block: header int32:flags* 	arcs: header int32:block_no arc* 	arc:  int32:dest_block int32:flags         lines: header int32:block_no line*                int32:0 string:NULL 	line:  int32:line_no | int32:0 string:filename     The BASIC_BLOCK record holds per-bb flags.  The number of blocks    can be inferred from its data length.  There is one ARCS record per    basic block.  The number of arcs from a bb is implicit from the    data length.  It enumerates the destination bb and per-arc flags.    There is one LINES record per basic block, it enumerates the source    lines which belong to that basic block.  Source file names are    introduced by a line number of 0, following lines are from the new    source file.  The initial source file for the function is NULL, but    the current source file should be remembered from one LINES record    to the next.  The end of a block is indicated by an empty filename    - this does not reset the current source file.  Note there is no    ordering of the ARCS and LINES records: they may be in any order,    interleaved in any manner.  The current filename follows the order    the LINES records are stored in the file, *not* the ordering of the    blocks they are for.     The data file contains the following records.         data: {unit function-data* summary:object summary:program*}* 	unit: header int32:checksum         function-data:	announce_function arc_counts 	announce_function: header int32:ident int32:checksum 	arc_counts: header int64:count* 	summary: int32:checksum {count-summary}GCOV_COUNTERS 	count-summary:	int32:num int32:runs int64:sum 			int64:max int64:sum_max     The ANNOUNCE_FUNCTION record is the same as that in the note file,    but without the source location.  The ARC_COUNTS gives the counter    values for those arcs that are instrumented.  The SUMMARY records    give information about the whole object file and about the whole    program.  The checksum is used for whole program summaries, and    disambiguates different programs which include the same    instrumented object file.  There may be several program summaries,    each with a unique checksum.  The object summary's checksum is zero.    Note that the data file might contain information from several runs    concatenated, or the data might be merged.     This file is included by both the compiler, gcov tools and the    runtime support library libgcov. IN_LIBGCOV and IN_GCOV are used to    distinguish which case is which.  If IN_LIBGCOV is nonzero,    libgcov is being built. If IN_GCOV is nonzero, the gcov tools are    being built. Otherwise the compiler is being built. IN_GCOV may be    positive or negative. If positive, we are compiling a tool that    requires additional functions (see the code for knowledge of what    those functions are).  */
