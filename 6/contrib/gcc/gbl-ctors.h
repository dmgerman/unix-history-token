This macro is used in two places in crtstuff.c (for    systems which support a .init section) and in one place in libgcc2.c    (for those system which do *not* support a .init section).  For all    three places where this code might appear, it must be identical, so    we define it once here as a macro to avoid various instances getting    out-of-sync with one another.  */
