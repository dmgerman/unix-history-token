comment|/*  * On this machine, the only purpose for which sf_buf is used is to implement  * an opaque pointer required by the machine-independent parts of the kernel.  * That pointer references the vm_page that is "mapped" by the sf_buf.  The  * actual mapping is provided by the direct virtual-to-physical mapping.    */
