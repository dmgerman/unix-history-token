comment|// This pass performs loop invariant code motion, attempting to remove as much
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|// code from the body of a loop as possible.  It does this by either hoisting
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|// code into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|// safe.  This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|// live in registers, thus hoisting and sinking "invariant" loads and stores.

begin_comment
comment|// This pass uses alias analysis for two purposes:

end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//  1. Moving loop invariant loads and calls out of loops.  If we can determine
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//     that a load or call inside of a loop never aliases anything stored to,
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//     we can hoist it or sink it like any other instruction.
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//  2. Scalar Promotion of Memory - If there is a store instruction inside of
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//     the loop, we try to move the store to happen AFTER the loop instead of
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//     inside of the loop.  This can only happen if a few conditions are true:
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//       A. The pointer stored through is loop invariant
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//       B. There are no stores or loads in the loop which _may_ alias the
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//          pointer.  There are no calls in the loop which mod/ref the pointer.
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//     If these conditions are true, we can promote the loads and stores in the
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//     loop of the pointer to use a temporary alloca'd variable.  We then use
end_comment

begin_comment
comment|//     the SSAUpdater to construct the appropriate SSA form for the value.
