comment|/*  NAME  	bcopy -- copy memory regions of arbitrary length  SYNOPSIS  	void bcopy (char *in, char *out, int length)  DESCRIPTION  	Copy LENGTH bytes from memory region pointed to by IN to memory 	region pointed to by OUT.  BUGS 	Significant speed improvements can be made in some cases by 	implementing copies of multiple bytes simultaneously, or unrolling 	the copy loop.  */
