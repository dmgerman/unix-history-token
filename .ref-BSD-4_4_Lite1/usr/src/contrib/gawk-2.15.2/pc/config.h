comment|/*  * This file isolates configuration dependencies for gnu awk.  * You should know something about your system, perhaps by having  * a manual handy, when you edit this file.  You should copy config.h-dist  * to config.h, and edit config.h.  Do not modify config.h-dist, so that  * it will be easy to apply any patches that may be distributed.  *  * The general idea is that systems conforming to the various standards  * should need to do the least amount of changing.  Definining the various  * items in ths file usually means that your system is missing that  * particular feature.  *  * The order of preference in standard conformance is ANSI C, POSIX,  * and the SVID.  *  * If you have no clue as to what's going on with your system, try  * compiling gawk without editing this file and see what shows up  * missing in the link stage.  From there, you can probably figure out  * which defines to turn on.  */
