comment|/*  * Until such time as the kernel can produce accurate core dumps of an  * address space (rather than just of a traditional address space), ld.so  * "knows" about the implementation of stack frames in SunOS.  In particular,  * it "knows" that the environment strings are placed at the "top end" of  * the stack frame on process initialization.  This program verifies that  * this knowledge remains "true" -- and will cause a build of ld.so to fail  * in the event it ever becomes "not true."  (Note: of course, this technique  * itself depends upon the build environment matching the execution one --  * not always a guarantee.)  */
