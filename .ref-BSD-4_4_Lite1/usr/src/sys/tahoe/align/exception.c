comment|/*  * Signal an exception. It will be handled by 'locore.s'. Here, I:  *	1) Put the exception code where it belongs on the stack.  *	2) Restore pc and sp to show that the current opcode  *		'was not executed'.  *	3) Execute one big non-local-goto. In the process we take care  *		to reset the current HW fp such that 'alignment' will  *		indeed return to 'locore.s'.  *		IMPORTANT NOTE : the process I use will NOT restore  *		all registers (like normal returns) so the call to the  *		handling routine HAS TO BE the last thing in 'alignment'.  *		Otherwise, all its own register variables will be a mess !!  *		I also know that 'alignment' itself WILL restore all  *		registers for 'locore.s' since its entry mask is all-1.  */
