comment|/*  * Basic strategy:  *  * The loader takes a number of files and libraries as arguments.  * A first pass examines each file in turn.  Normal files are  * unconditionally loaded, and the (external) symbols they define and require  * are noted in the symbol table.   Libraries are searched, and the  * library members which define needed symbols are remembered  * in a special data structure so they can be selected on the second  * pass.  Symbols defined and required by library members are also  * recorded.  *  * After the first pass, the loader knows the size of the basic text  * data, and bss segments from the sum of the sizes of the modules which  * were required.  It has computed, for each ``common'' symbol, the  * maximum size of any reference to it, and these symbols are then assigned  * storage locations after their sizes are appropriately rounded.  * The loader now knows all sizes for the eventual output file, and  * can determine the final locations of external symbols before it  * begins a second pass.  *  * On the second pass each normal file and required library member  * is processed again.  The symbol table for each such file is  * reread and relevant parts of it are placed in the output.  The offsets  * in the local symbol table for externally defined symbols are recorded  * since relocation information refers to symbols in this way.  * Armed with all necessary information, the text and data segments  * are relocated and the result is placed in the output file, which  * is pasted together, ``in place'', by writing to it in several  * different places concurrently.  */
