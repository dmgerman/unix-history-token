comment|/*  * set_altfname --  *	Set the alternate file name.  *  * Swap the alternate file name.  The reason it's a routine is that I wanted  * some place to hang this comment.  The alternate file name (normally  * referenced using the special character '#' during file expansion) is set  * by a large number of operations.  In the historic vi, the commands "ex",  * "edit" and "next file" obviously set the alternate file name because they  * switched the underlying file.  Less obviously, the "read", "file", "write"  * and "wq" commands set it as well.  In this implementation, the new  * commands "previous", "split", and "mkexrc" have been added to the list.  * Where it gets interesting is that the alternate file name is set multiple  * times by some commands.  If an edit attempt fails (for whatever reason,  * like the current file is modified but as yet unwritten), it is set to the  * file name that the user didn't get to edit.  If the edit succeeds, it is  * set to the last file name that was edited.  Good fun.  *  * XXX: add errlist if it doesn't get ripped out.  */
