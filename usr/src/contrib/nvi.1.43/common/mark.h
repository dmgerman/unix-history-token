comment|/*  * The MARK and LMARK structures define positions in the file.  There are  * two structures because the mark subroutines are the only places where  * anything cares about something other than line and column.  *  * Because of the different interfaces used by the db(3) package, curses,  * and users, the line number is 1 based and the column number is 0 based.  * Additionally, it is known that the out-of-band line number is less than  * any legal line number.  The line number is of type recno_t, as that's  * the underlying type of the database.  The column number is of type size_t,  * guaranteeing that we can malloc a line.  */
