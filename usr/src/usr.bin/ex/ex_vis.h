The top line of the window is WTOP,  * and the bottom line WBOT.  The line WECHO is used for messages,  * search strings and the like.  If WBOT==WECHO then we are in ONEOPEN  * or HARDOPEN and there is no way back to the line we were on if we  * go to WECHO (i.e. we will have to scroll before we go there, and  * we can't get back).  There are WCOLS columns per line.  * If WBOT!=WECHO then WECHO will be the last line on the screen  * and WBOT is the line before it.  */
