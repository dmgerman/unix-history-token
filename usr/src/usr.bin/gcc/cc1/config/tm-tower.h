comment|/* Definitions of target machine for GNU compiler.    Copyright (C) 1990 Free Software Foundation, Inc.     Written by Robert Andersson, International Systems, Oslo, Norway.    Please send bug reports, questions and improvements to ra@intsys.no.     For NCR Tower 32/4x0 and 32/6x0 running System V Release 3.    I don't have access to 200/700/800/850 machines, so I don't know if it    works on those as well.  It shouldn't be far from it however.    The hardware floating point support is completely untested, as I do    not have access to a machine with a 6888x FPU in it.    It does not work on the System V Release 2 based OS releases.  Making it    work will not be easy, due to the silly way in which stack expansion is    implemented in the OS.
