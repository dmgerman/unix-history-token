comment|/*  * The following are the low-level opcodes exchanged between the  * two sides.  These are designed to allow for type, sequence number,  * and direction checking.  *  * We enforce conversation flow.  There are three states: CONTENTION,  * SEND, and RECEIVE.  Both sides start in CONTENTION.  * We never leave RECEIVE state without first reading a TURNAROUND  * opcode.  We never leave SEND state without first writing a TURNAROUND  * opcode.  This scheme ensures that we always have conversation flowing  * in a synchronized direction (or detect an application error), and that  * we never hang with both sides trying to read from the "wire".  *  * State	event			action  *  * CONTENTION	read request		send TURNAROUND  *					read RTS  *					enter RECEIVE  * CONTENTION	write request		send RTS  *					read TURNAROUND  *					enter SEND  *  * RECEIVE	read request		read whatever  * RECEIVE	write request		read TURNAROUND  *  * SEND		read request		send TURNAROUND  * SEND		write			write whatever  */
