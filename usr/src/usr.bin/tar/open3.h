comment|/*  * @(#)open3.h 1.4 87/11/11  *  * open3.h -- #defines for the various flags for the Sys V style 3-argument  * open() call.  On BSD or System 5, the system already has this in an  * include file.  This file is needed for V7 and MINIX systems for the  * benefit of open3() in port.c, a routine that emulates the 3-argument  * call using system calls available on V7/MINIX.   *  * This file is needed by PD tar even if we aren't using the  * emulator, since the #defines for O_WRONLY, etc. are used in  * a couple of places besides the open() calls, (e.g. in the assignment  * to openflag in extract.c).  We just #include this rather than  * #ifdef them out.  *  * Written 6/10/87 by rmtodd@uokmax (Richard Todd).  *  * The names have been changed by John Gilmore, 31 July 1987, since  * Richard called it "bsdopen", and really this change was introduced in  * AT&T Unix systems before BSD picked it up.  */
