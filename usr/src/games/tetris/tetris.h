comment|/*  * A `shape' is the fundamental thing that makes up the game.  There  * are 7 basic shapes, each consisting of four `blots':  *  *	X.X	  X.X		X.X  *	  X.X	X.X	X.X.X	X.X	X.X.X	X.X.X	X.X.X.X  *			  X		X	    X  *  *	  0	  1	  2	  3	  4	  5	  6  *  * Except for 3 and 6, the center of each shape is one of the blots.  * This blot is designated (0,0).  The other three blots can then be  * described as offsets from the center.  Shape 3 is the same under  * rotation, so its center is effectively irrelevant; it has been chosen  * so that it `sticks out' upward and leftward.  Except for shape 6,  * all the blots are contained in a box going from (-1,-1) to (+1,+1);  * shape 6's center `wobbles' as it rotates, so that while it `sticks out'  * rightward, its rotation---a vertical line---`sticks out' downward.  * The containment box has to include the offset (2,0), making the overall  * containment box range from offset (-1,-1) to (+2,+1).  (This is why  * there is only one row above, but two rows below, the display area.)  *  * The game works by choosing one of these shapes at random and putting  * its center at the middle of the first display row (row 1, column 5).  * The shape is moved steadily downward until it collides with something:  * either  another shape, or the bottom of the board.  When the shape can  * no longer be moved downwards, it is merged into the current board.  * At this time, any completely filled rows are elided, and blots above  * these rows move down to make more room.  A new random shape is again  * introduced at the top of the board, and the whole process repeats.  * The game ends when the new shape will not fit at (1,5).  *  * While the shapes are falling, the user can rotate them counterclockwise  * 90 degrees (in addition to moving them left or right), provided that the  * rotation puts the blots in empty spaces.  The table of shapes is set up  * so that each shape contains the index of the new shape obtained by  * rotating the current shape.  Due to symmetry, each shape has exactly  * 1, 2, or 4 rotations total; the first 7 entries in the table represent  * the primary shapes, and the remaining 12 represent their various  * rotated forms.  */
