Allman 5/76 (U.C. Berkeley) with help **		from Jeff Poskanzer and Pete Rubinstein. ** **	I also want to thank everyone here at Berkeley who **	where crazy enough to play the undebugged game.  I want to **	particularly thank Nick Whyte, who made considerable **	suggestions regarding the content of the game.  Why, I'll **	never forget the time he suggested the name for the **	"capture" command. ** **	Please send comments, questions, and suggestions about this **		game to: **			Eric P. Allman **			Project INGRES **			Electronics Research Laboratory **			Cory Hall **			University of California **			Berkeley, California  94720 ** **	If you make ANY changes in the game, I sure would like to **	know about them.  It is sort of an ongoing project for me, **	and I very much want to put in any bug fixes and improvements **	that you might come up with. ** **	FORTRASH version by Kay R. Fisher (DEC) "and countless others". **	That was adapted from the "original BASIC program" (ha!) by **		Mike Mayfield (Centerline Engineering). ** **	Additional inspiration taken from FORTRAN version by **		David Matuszek and Paul Reynolds which runs on the CDC **		7600 at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, maintained there by **		Andy Davidson.  This version is also available at LLL **		and at LMSC.  In all fairness, this version was the **		major inspiration for this version of the game (trans- **		lation:  I ripped off a whole lot of code). ** **	Minor other input from the "Battelle Version 7A" by Joe Miller **		(Graphics Systems Group, Battelle-Columbus Labs) and **		Ross Pavlac (Systems Programmer, Battelle Memorial **		Institute).  That version was written in December '74 **		and extensively modified June '75.  It was adapted **		from the FTN version by Ron Williams of CDC Sunnyvale, **		which was adapted from the Basic version distributed **		by DEC.  It also had "neat stuff swiped" from T. T. **		Terry and Jim Korp (University of Texas), Hicks (Penn **		U.), and Rick Maus (Georgia Tech).  Unfortunately, it **		was not as readable as it could have been and so the **		translation effort was severely hampered.  None the **		less, I got the idea of inhabited starsystems from this **		version. ** **	Permission is given for use, copying, and modification of **		all or part of this program and related documentation, **		provided that all reference to the authors are maintained. ** ** ********************************************************************** ** **  NOTES TO THE MAINTAINER: ** **	There is a compilation option xTRACE which must be set for any **	trace information to be generated.  It is probably defined in **	the version that you get.  It can be removed, however, if you **	have trouble finding room in core. ** **	Many things in trek are not as clear as they might be, but are **	done to reduce space.  I compile with the -f and -O flags.  I **	am constrained to running with non-seperated I/D space, since **	we don't have doubleing point hardware here; even if we did, I **	would like trek to be available to the large number of people **	who either have an 11/40 or do not have FP hardware.  I also **	found it desirable to make the code run reentrant, so this **	added even more space constraints. ** **	I use the portable C library to do my I/O.  This is done be- **	cause I wanted the game easily transportable to other C **	implementations, and because I was too lazy to do the doubleing **	point input myself.  Little did I know.  The portable C library **	released by Bell Labs has more bugs than you would believe, so **	I ended up rewriting the whole blessed thing.  Trek excercises **	many of the bugs in it, as well as bugs in some of the section **	III UNIX routines.  We have fixed them here.  One main problem **	was a bug in alloc() that caused it to always ask for a large **	hunk of memory, which worked fine unless you were almost out, **	which I inevitably was.  If you want the code for all of this **	stuff, it is also available through me. ** *********************************************************************** */
