block|,
literal|"terclockwise from 24 to 1)."
block|,
literal|"\n   A turn consists of rolling the dice, and moving the number of"
block|,
literal|"positions indicated on each die.  The two numbers can be used to"
block|,
literal|"move one man the sum of the two rolls, or two men the number on"
block|,
literal|"each individual die.  For example, if red rolled 6 3 at the start"
block|,
literal|"of the game, he might move a man from 1 to 7 to 10, using both"
block|,
literal|"dice for one man, or he might move two men from position 12, one"
block|,
literal|"to 15 and one to 18.  (Red did not have to choose two men start-"
block|,
literal|"ing from the same position.)  In addition, doubles are treated"
block|,
literal|"specially in backgammon.  When a player rolls doubles, he gets to"
block|,
literal|"move as if he had four dice instead of two.  For instance, if you"
block|,

block|,
literal|"cannot place his men there, even if passing through on the way to"
block|,

block|,

block|,
literal|"\n   The most important part of the game is removing men, since"
block|,
literal|"that is how you win the game.  Once a man is removed, he stays"
block|,
literal|"off the board for the duration of the game.  However, a player"
block|,
literal|"cannot remove men until all his men are on his 'inner table,' or"
block|,
literal|"the last six positions of the board (19-24 for red, 6-1 for"
block|,

block|,
literal|"\n   To get off the board, a player must roll the exact number to"
block|,
literal|"get his man one position past the last position on the board, or"

literal|"his 'home.'  Hence, if red wanted to remove a man from position"
block|,
literal|"23, he would have to roll a 2, anything else would be used for"
block|,
literal|"another man, or for another purpose.  However, there is one ex-"
block|,
literal|"ception.  If the player rolling has no men far enough to move the"
block|,
literal|"roll made, he may move his farthest man off the board.  For exam-"
block|,
literal|"ple, if red's farthest man back was on position 21, he could re-"
block|,
literal|"move men from that position if he rolled a 5 or a 6, as well as a"
block|,

block|,
literal|"on 19 (where he could use a 6), he can use these rolls for posi-"

literal|"the potential of getting hit by an opposing man.  When a player's"
