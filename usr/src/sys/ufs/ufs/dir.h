comment|/*  * A directory consists of some number of blocks of DIRBLKSIZ  * bytes, where DIRBLKSIZ is chosen such that it can be transferred  * to disk in a single atomic operation (e.g. 512 bytes on most machines).  *  * Each DIRBLKSIZ byte block contains some number of directory entry  * structures, which are of variable length.  Each directory entry has  * a struct direct at the front of it, containing its inode number,  * the length of the entry, and the length of the name contained in  * the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4 byte boundary  * with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.  * The maximum length of a name in a directory is MAXNAMLEN.  *  * The macro DIRSIZ(fmt, dp) gives the amount of space required to represent  * a directory entry.  Free space in a directory is represented by  * entries which have dp->d_reclen> DIRSIZ(fmt, dp).  All DIRBLKSIZ bytes  * in a directory block are claimed by the directory entries.  This  * usually results in the last entry in a directory having a large  * dp->d_reclen.  When entries are deleted from a directory, the  * space is returned to the previous entry in the same directory  * block by increasing its dp->d_reclen.  If the first entry of  * a directory block is free, then its dp->d_ino is set to 0.  * Entries other than the first in a directory do not normally have  * dp->d_ino set to 0.  */
