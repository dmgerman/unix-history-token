comment|/*  * cgthree display registers.  *  * The registers start at offset 0x400000 and repeat every 32 bytes  * (presumably only the low order address lines are decoded).  Video RAM  * starts at offset 0x800000.  We use separate pointers to each so that  * the sparc addressing modes work well.  *  * The cg3 has a Brooktree Bt458 (?) chip to do everything (Brooktree  * makes the only decent color frame buffer chips).  To update the  * color map one would normally do byte writes, but the hardware  * takes longword writes.  Since there are three registers for each  * color map entry (R, then G, then B), we have to set color 1 with  * a write to address 0 (setting 0's R/G/B and color 1's R) followed  * by a second write to address 1 (setting color 1's G/B and color 2's  * R/G).  Software must therefore keep a copy of the current map.  *  * The colormap address register increments automatically, so the above  * write is done as:  *  *	p->cg3_cadr = 0;  *	p->cg3_cmap = R0G0B0R1;  *	p->cg3_cmap = G1B1R2G2;  *  * Yow!  */
