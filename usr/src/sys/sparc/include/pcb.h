comment|/*  * SPARC Process Control Block.  *  * pcb_uw is positive if there are any user windows that are  * are currently in the CPU windows rather than on the user  * stack.  Whenever we are running in the kernel with traps  * enabled, we decrement pcb_uw for each ``push'' of a CPU  * register window into the stack, and we increment it for  * each ``pull'' from the stack into the CPU.  (If traps are  * disabled, or if we are in user mode, pcb_uw is junk.)  *  * To ease computing pcb_uw on traps from user mode, we keep track  * of the log base 2 of the single bit that is set in %wim.  *  * If an overflow occurs while the associated user stack pages  * are invalid (paged out), we have to store the registers  * in a page that is locked in core while the process runs,  * i.e., right here in the pcb.  We also need the stack pointer  * for the last such window (but only the last, as the others  * are in each window) and the count of windows saved.  We  * cheat by having a whole window structure for that one %sp.  * Thus, to save window pcb_rw[i] to memory, we write it at  * pcb_rw[i + 1].rw_in[6].  *  * pcb_nsaved has three `kinds' of values.  If 0, it means no  * registers are in the PCB (though if pcb_uw is positive,  * there may be the next time you look).  If positive, it means  * there are no user registers in the CPU, but there are some  * saved in pcb_rw[].  As a special case, traps that needed  * assistance to pull user registers from the stack also store  * the registers in pcb_rw[], and set pcb_nsaved to -1.  This  * special state is normally short-term: it can only last until the  * trap returns, and it can never persist across entry to user code.  */
