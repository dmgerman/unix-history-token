Basically this says that if you are  * swapped in you deserve some resources.  We protect the last SAFERSS  * pages against paging and will just swap you out rather than paging you.  * Note that each process has at least UPAGES+CLSIZE pages which are not  * paged anyways (this is currently 8+2=10 pages or 5k bytes), so this  * number just means a swapped in process is given around 25k bytes.  * Just for fun: current memory prices are 4600$ a megabyte on VAX (4/22/81),  * so we loan each swapped in process memory worth 100$, or just admit  * that we don't consider it worthwhile and swap it out to disk which costs  * $30/mb or about $0.75.  */
