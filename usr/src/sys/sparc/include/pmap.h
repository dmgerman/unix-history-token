comment|/*  * Pmap structure.  *  * The pmap structure really comes in two variants, one---a single  * instance---for kernel virtual memory and the other---up to nproc  * instances---for user virtual memory.  Unfortunately, we have to mash  * both into the same structure.  Fortunately, they are almost the same.  *  * The kernel begins at 0xf8000000 and runs to 0xffffffff (although  * some of this is not actually used).  Kernel space, including DVMA  * space (for now?), is mapped identically into all user contexts.  * There is no point in duplicating this mapping in each user process  * so they do not appear in the user structures.  *  * User space begins at 0x00000000 and runs through 0x1fffffff,  * then has a `hole', then resumes at 0xe0000000 and runs until it  * hits the kernel space at 0xf8000000.  This can be mapped  * contiguously by ignorning the top two bits and pretending the  * space goes from 0 to 37ffffff.  Typically the lower range is  * used for text+data and the upper for stack, but the code here  * makes no such distinction.  *  * Since each virtual segment covers 256 kbytes, the user space  * requires 3584 segments, while the kernel (including DVMA) requires  * only 512 segments.  *  * The segment map entry for virtual segment vseg is offset in  * pmap->pm_rsegmap by 0 if pmap is not the kernel pmap, or by  * NUSEG if it is.  We keep a pointer called pmap->pm_segmap  * pre-offset by this value.  pmap->pm_segmap thus contains the  * values to be loaded into the user portion of the hardware segment  * map so as to reach the proper PMEGs within the MMU.  The kernel  * mappings are `set early' and are always valid in every context  * (every change is always propagated immediately).  *  * The PMEGs within the MMU are loaded `on demand'; when a PMEG is  * taken away from context `c', the pmap for context c has its  * corresponding pm_segmap[vseg] entry marked invalid (the MMU segment  * map entry is also made invalid at the same time).  Thus  * pm_segmap[vseg] is the `invalid pmeg' number (127 or 511) whenever  * the corresponding PTEs are not actually in the MMU.  On the other  * hand, pm_pte[vseg] is NULL only if no pages in that virtual segment  * are in core; otherwise it points to a copy of the 32 or 64 PTEs that  * must be loaded in the MMU in order to reach those pages.  * pm_npte[vseg] counts the number of valid pages in each vseg.  *  * XXX performance: faster to count valid bits?  *  * The kernel pmap cannot malloc() PTEs since malloc() will sometimes  * allocate a new virtual segment.  Since kernel mappings are never  * `stolen' out of the the MMU, we just keep all its PTEs there, and  * have no software copies.  Its mmu entries are nonetheless kept on lists  * so that the code that fiddles with mmu lists has something to fiddle.  */
