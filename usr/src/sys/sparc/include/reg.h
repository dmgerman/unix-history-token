comment|/*  * Register windows.  Each stack pointer (%o6 aka %sp) in each window  * must ALWAYS point to some place at which it is safe to scribble on  * 64 bytes.  (If not, your process gets mangled.)  Furthermore, each  * stack pointer should be aligned on an 8-byte boundary (the kernel  * as currently coded allows arbitrary alignment, but with a hefty  * performance penalty).  */
