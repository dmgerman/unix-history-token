comment|/*  * Sun-4 and Sun-4c virtual address cache.  *  * Sun-4 virtual caches come in two flavors, write-through (Sun-4c)  * and write-back (Sun-4).  The write-back caches are much faster  * but require a bit more care.  *  * VAC_NONE is not actually used now, but if someone builds a physical  * cache Sun-4 (or, more likely, a virtual index/physical tag cache)  * everything will work (after pulling out the #ifdef notdef's: grep  * for VAC_NONE to find them).  */

comment|/*  * Cache tags can be written in control space, and must be set to 0  * (or invalid anyway) before turning on the cache.  The tags are  * addressed as an array of 32-bit structures of the form:  *  *	struct cache_tag {  *		u_int	:7,		(unused; must be zero)  *			ct_cid:3,	(context ID)  *			ct_w:1,		(write flag from PTE)  *			ct_s:1,		(supervisor flag from PTE)  *			ct_v:1,		(set => cache entry is valid)  *			:3,		(unused; must be zero)  *			ct_tid:14,	(cache tag ID)  *			:2;		(unused; must be zero)  *	};  *  * The cache sees virtual addresses as:  *  *	struct cache_va {  *		u_int	:2,		(unused; probably copies of va_tid<13>)  *			cva_tid:14,	(tag ID)  *			cva_line:12,	(cache line number)  *			cva_byte:4;	(byte in cache line)  *	};  *  * Note that, because the 12-bit line ID is `wider' than the page offset,  * it is possible to have one page map to two different cache lines.  * This can happen whenever two different physical pages have the same bits  * in the part of the virtual address that overlaps the cache line ID, i.e.,  * bits<15:12>.  In order to prevent cache duplication, we have to  * make sure that no one page has more than one virtual address where  * (va1& 0xf000) != (va2& 0xf000).  (The cache hardware turns off ct_v  * when a cache miss occurs on a write, i.e., if va1 is in the cache and  * va2 is not, and you write to va2, va1 goes out of the cache.  If va1  * is in the cache and va2 is not, reading va2 also causes va1 to become  * uncached, and the [same] data is then read from main memory into the  * cache.)  *  * The other alternative, of course, is to disable caching of aliased  * pages.  (In a few cases this might be faster anyway, but we do it  * only when forced.)  *  * THE CURRENT VM CODE DOES NOT ALLOW US TO SPECIFY PREFERRED VIRTUAL  * ADDRESSES ... THIS MUST BE FIXED!  */
