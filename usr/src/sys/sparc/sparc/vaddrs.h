comment|/*  * Special (fixed) virtual addresses on the SPARC.  *  * IO virtual space begins at 0xfe000000 (a segment boundary) and  * continues up to the DMVA edge at 0xff000000.  (The upper all-1s  * byte is special since some of the hardware supplies this to pad  * a 24-bit address space out to 32 bits.  This is a legacy of the  * IBM PC AT bus, actually, just so you know who to blame.)  *  * We reserve several pages at the base of our IO virtual space  * for `oft-used' devices which must be present anyway in order to  * configure.  In particular, we want the counter-timer register and  * the Zilog ZSCC serial port chips to be mapped at fixed VAs to make  * microtime() and the zs hardware interrupt handlers faster.  *  * Ideally, we should map the interrupt enable register here as well,  * but that would require allocating pmegs in locore.s, so instead we  * use one of the two `wasted' pages at KERNBASE+2*NBPG (see locore.s).  */
