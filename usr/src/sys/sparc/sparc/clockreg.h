The ``host id'' is set up by taking the machine  * ID as the top byte and the hostid field as the remaining three.  * The id_xxx0 field appears to contain some other number.  The id_xxx1  * contains a bunch of 00's and a5's on my machines, suggesting it is  * not actually used.  The checksum seems to include them, however.  */
