comment|/*  * Protocol control block for an active  * instance of a UNIX internal protocol.  *  * A socket may be associated with an vnode in the  * file system.  If so, the unp_vnode pointer holds  * a reference count to this vnode, which should be irele'd  * when the socket goes away.  *  * A socket may be connected to another socket, in which  * case the control block of the socket to which it is connected  * is given by unp_conn.  *  * A socket may be referenced by a number of sockets (e.g. several  * sockets may be connected to a datagram socket.)  These sockets  * are in a linked list starting with unp_refs, linked through  * unp_nextref and null-terminated.  Note that a socket may be referenced  * by a number of other sockets and may also reference a socket (not  * necessarily one which is referencing it).  This generates  * the need for unp_refs and unp_nextref to be separate fields.  *  * Stream sockets keep copies of receive sockbuf sb_cc and sb_mbcnt  * so that changes in the sockbuf may be computed to modify  * back pressure on the sender accordingly.  */
