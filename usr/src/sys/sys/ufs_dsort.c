comment|/*  * Seek sort for disks.  We depend on the driver  * which calls us using b_resid as the current cylinder number.  *  * The argument dp structure holds a b_actf activity chain pointer  * on which we keep two queues, sorted in ascending cylinder order.  * The first queue holds those requests which are positioned after  * the current cylinder (in the first request); the second holds  * requests which came in after their cylinder number was passed.  * Thus we implement a one way scan, retracting after reaching the  * end of the drive to the first request on the second queue,  * at which time it becomes the first queue.  *  * A one-way scan is natural because of the way UNIX read-ahead  * blocks are allocated.  */
