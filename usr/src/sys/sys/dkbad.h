comment|/*  * Definitions needed to perform bad sector revectoring ala DEC STD 144.  *  * The bad sector information is located in the first 5 even numbered  * sectors of the last track of the disk pack.  There are five identical  * copies of the information, described by the dkbad structure.  *  * Replacement sectors are allocated starting with the first sector before  * the bad sector information and working backwards towards the beginning of  * the disk.  A maximum of 126 bad sectors are supported.  The position of  * the bad sector in the bad sector table determines which replacement sector  * it corresponds to.  *  * The bad sector information and replacement sectors are conventionally  * only accessible through the 'c' file system partition of the disk.  If  * that partition is used for a file system, the user is responsible for  * making sure that it does not overlap the bad sector information or any  * replacement sectors.  */
