comment|/*  * Resource allocation maps.  *  * Associated routines manage sub-allocation of an address space using  * an array of segment descriptors.  The first element of this array  * is a map structure, describing the arrays extent and the name  * of the controlled object.  Each additional structure represents  * a free segment of the address space.  *  * A call to rminit initializes a resource map and may also be used  * to free some address space for the map.  Subsequent calls to rmalloc  * and rmfree allocate and free space in the resource map.  If the resource  * map becomes too fragmented to be described in the available space,  * then some of the resource is discarded.  This may lead to critical  * shortages, but is better than not checking (as the previous versions  * of these routines did) or giving up and calling panic().  The routines  * could use linked lists and call a memory allocator when they run  * out of space, but that would not solve the out of space problem when  * called at interrupt time.  *  * N.B.: The address 0 in the resource address space is not available  * as it is used internally by the resource map routines.  */
