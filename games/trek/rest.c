comment|/* **  REST FOR REPAIRS ** **	You sit around and wait for repairs to happen.  Actually, you **	sit around and wait for anything to happen.  I do want to point **	out however, that Klingons are not as patient as you are, and **	they tend to attack you while you are resting. ** **	You can never rest through a long range tractor beam. ** **	In events() you will be given an opportunity to cancel the **	rest period if anything momentous happens. */
