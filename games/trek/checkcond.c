comment|/* **  Check for Condition After a Move ** **	Various ship conditions are checked.  First we check **	to see if we have already lost the game, due to running **	out of life support reserves, running out of energy, **	or running out of crew members.  The check for running **	out of time is in events(). ** **	If we are in automatic override mode (Etc.nkling< 0), we **	don't want to do anything else, lest we call autover **	recursively. ** **	In the normal case, if there is a supernova, we call **	autover() to help us escape.  If after calling autover() **	we are still in the grips of a supernova, we get burnt **	up. ** **	If there are no Klingons in this quadrant, we nullify any **	distress calls which might exist. ** **	We then set the condition code, based on the energy level **	and battle conditions. */
