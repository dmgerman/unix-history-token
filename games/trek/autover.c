comment|/* **  Automatic Override ** **	If we should be so unlucky as to be caught in a quadrant **	with a supernova in it, this routine is called.  It is **	called from checkcond(). ** **	It sets you to a random warp (guaranteed to be over 6.0) **	and starts sending you off "somewhere" (whereever that is). ** **	Please note that it is VERY important that you reset your **	warp speed after the automatic override is called.  The new **	warp factor does not stay in effect for just this routine. ** **	This routine will never try to send you more than sqrt(2) **	quadrants, since that is all that is needed. */
