comment|/*  *  * Some numerical conventions:  *  *	Arrays have white's value in [0], red in [1].  *	Numeric values which are one color or the other use  *	-1 for white, 1 for red.  *	Hence, white will be negative values, red positive one.  *	This makes a lot of sense since white is going in decending  *	order around the board, and red is ascending.  *  */
