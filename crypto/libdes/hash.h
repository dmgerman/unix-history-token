comment|/* Vector Crays doesn't have a good 32-bit type, or more precisely,    int32_t as defined by<bind/bitypes.h> isn't 32 bits, and we don't    want to depend in being able to redefine this type.  To cope with    this we have to clamp the result in some places to [0,2^32); no    need to do this on other machines.  Did I say this was a mess?    */
