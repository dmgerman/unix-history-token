comment|/* For posterity, the issue here begins initial "char []" decl for  * s. This is a tentative definition and so a global was being  * emitted, however the mapping in GlobalDeclMap referred to a bitcast  * of this global.  *  * The problem was that later when the correct definition for s is  * emitted we were doing a RAUW on the old global which was destroying  * the bitcast in the GlobalDeclMap (since it cannot be replaced  * properly), leaving a dangling pointer.  *  * The purpose of bar is just to trigger a use of the old decl  * sometime after the dangling pointer has been introduced.  */
