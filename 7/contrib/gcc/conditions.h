comment|/* The variable cc_status says how to interpret the condition code.    It is set by output routines for an instruction that sets the cc's    and examined by output routines for jump instructions.     cc_status contains two components named `value1' and `value2'    that record two equivalent expressions for the values that the    condition codes were set from.  (Either or both may be null if    there is no useful expression to record.)  These fields are    used for eliminating redundant test and compare instructions    in the cases where the condition codes were already set by the    previous instruction.     cc_status.flags contains flags which say that the condition codes    were set in a nonstandard manner.  The output of jump instructions    uses these flags to compensate and produce the standard result    with the nonstandard condition codes.  Standard flags are defined here.    The tm.h file can also define other machine-dependent flags.     cc_status also contains a machine-dependent component `mdep'    whose type, `CC_STATUS_MDEP', may be defined as a macro in the    tm.h file.  */
