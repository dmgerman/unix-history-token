comment|/*  * Following is where TCP initial sequence number generation occurs.  *  * There are two places where we must use initial sequence numbers:  * 1.  In SYN-ACK packets.  * 2.  In SYN packets.  *  * All ISNs for SYN-ACK packets are generated by the syncache.  See  * tcp_syncache.c for details.  *  * The ISNs in SYN packets must be monotonic; TIME_WAIT recycling  * depends on this property.  In addition, these ISNs should be  * unguessable so as to prevent connection hijacking.  To satisfy  * the requirements of this situation, the algorithm outlined in  * RFC 1948 is used, with only small modifications.  *  * Implementation details:  *  * Time is based off the system timer, and is corrected so that it  * increases by one megabyte per second.  This allows for proper  * recycling on high speed LANs while still leaving over an hour  * before rollover.  *  * As reading the *exact* system time is too expensive to be done  * whenever setting up a TCP connection, we increment the time  * offset in two ways.  First, a small random positive increment  * is added to isn_offset for each connection that is set up.  * Second, the function tcp_isn_tick fires once per clock tick  * and increments isn_offset as necessary so that sequence numbers  * are incremented at approximately ISN_BYTES_PER_SECOND.  The  * random positive increments serve only to ensure that the same  * exact sequence number is never sent out twice (as could otherwise  * happen when a port is recycled in less than the system tick  * interval.)  *  * net.inet.tcp.isn_reseed_interval controls the number of seconds  * between seeding of isn_secret.  This is normally set to zero,  * as reseeding should not be necessary.  *  * Locking of the global variables isn_secret, isn_last_reseed, isn_offset,  * isn_offset_old, and isn_ctx is performed using the TCP pcbinfo lock.  In  * general, this means holding an exclusive (write) lock.  */
