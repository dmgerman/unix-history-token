comment|/*  * Definitions needed to perform bad sector  * revectoring ala DEC STD 144.  *  * The bad sector information is located in the  * first 5 even numbered sectors of the last  * track of the disk pack.  There are five  * identical copies of the information, described  * by the dkbad structure.  *  * Replacement sectors are allocated starting with  * the first sector before the bad sector information  * and working backwards towards the beginning of  * the disk.  A maximum of 126 bad sectors are supported.  * The position of the bad sector in the bad sector table  * determines which replacement sector it corresponds to.  *  * The bad sector information and replacement sectors  * are conventionally only accessible through the  * 'c' file system partition of the disk.  If that  * partition is used for a file system, the user is  * responsible for making sure that it does not overlap  * the bad sector information or any replacement sector.s  */
