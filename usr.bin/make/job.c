comment|/*-  * job.c --  *	handle the creation etc. of our child processes.  *  * Interface:  *	Job_Make	Start the creation of the given target.  *  *	Job_CatchChildren  *			Check for and handle the termination of any children.  *			This must be called reasonably frequently to keep the  *			whole make going at a decent clip, since job table  *			entries aren't removed until their process is caught  *			this way. Its single argument is TRUE if the function  *			should block waiting for a child to terminate.  *  *	Job_CatchOutput	Print any output our children have produced. Should  *			also be called fairly frequently to keep the user  *			informed of what's going on. If no output is waiting,  *			it will block for a time given by the SEL_* constants,  *			below, or until output is ready.  *  *	Job_Init	Called to intialize this module. in addition, any  *			commands attached to the .BEGIN target are executed  *			before this function returns. Hence, the makefile must  *			have been parsed before this function is called.  *  *	Job_Full	Return TRUE if the job table is filled.  *  *	Job_Empty	Return TRUE if the job table is completely empty.  *  *	Job_Finish	Perform any final processing which needs doing. This  *			includes the execution of any commands which have  *			been/were attached to the .END target. It should only  *			be called when the job table is empty.  *  *	Job_AbortAll	Abort all currently running jobs. It doesn't handle  *			output or do anything for the jobs, just kills them.  *			It should only be called in an emergency, as it were.  *  *	Job_CheckCommands  *			Verify that the commands for a target are ok. Provide  *			them if necessary and possible.  *  *	Job_Touch	Update a target without really updating it.  *  *	Job_Wait	Wait for all currently-running jobs to finish.  *  * compat.c --  *	The routines in this file implement the full-compatibility  *	mode of PMake. Most of the special functionality of PMake  *	is available in this mode. Things not supported:  *	    - different shells.  *	    - friendly variable substitution.  *  * Interface:  *	Compat_Run	    Initialize things for this module and recreate  *			    thems as need creatin'  */

Note  *	that we pay no attention to the JOB_IGNERR flag here.  *	This is because when we're called because of a noexecute flag  *	or something, jstat.w_status is 0 and when called from  *	Job_CatchChildren, the status is zeroed if it s/b ignored.  *  * Side Effects:  *	Some nodes may be put on the toBeMade queue.  *	Final commands for the job are placed on postCommands.  *  *	If we got an error and are aborting (aborting == ABORT_ERROR) and  *	the job list is now empty, we are done for the day.  *	If we recognized an error (errors !=0), we set the aborting flag  *	to ABORT_ERROR so no more jobs will be started.  */

In the former case, we are called  *	whenever there is something to read on the pipe. We collect more  *	output from the given job and store it in the job's outBuf. If  *	this makes up a line, we print it tagged by the job's identifier,  *	as necessary.  *	If output has been collected in a temporary file, we open the  *	file and read it line by line, transfering it to our own  *	output channel until the file is empty. At which point we  *	remove the temporary file.  *	In both cases, however, we keep our figurative eye out for the  *	'noPrint' line for the shell from which the output came. If  *	we recognize a line, we don't print it. If the command is not  *	alone on the line (the character after it is not \0 or \n), we  *	do print whatever follows it.  *  * Side Effects:  *	curPos may be shifted as may the contents of outBuf.  */
