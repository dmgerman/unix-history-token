comment|/*  *	A search path consists of a Lst of Path structures. A Path structure  *	has in it the name of the directory and a hash table of all the files  *	in the directory. This is used to cut down on the number of system  *	calls necessary to find implicit dependents and their like. Since  *	these searches are made before any actions are taken, we need not  *	worry about the directory changing due to creation commands. If this  *	hampers the style of some makefiles, they must be changed.  *  *	A list of all previously-read directories is kept in the  *	openDirectories Lst. This list is checked first before a directory  *	is opened.  *  *	The need for the caching of whole directories is brought about by  *	the multi-level transformation code in suff.c, which tends to search  *	for far more files than regular make does. In the initial  *	implementation, the amount of time spent performing "stat" calls was  *	truly astronomical. The problem with hashing at the start is,  *	of course, that pmake doesn't then detect changes to these directories  *	during the course of the make. Three possibilities suggest themselves:  *  *	    1) just use stat to test for a file's existence. As mentioned  *	       above, this is very inefficient due to the number of checks  *	       engendered by the multi-level transformation code.  *	    2) use readdir() and company to search the directories, keeping  *	       them open between checks. I have tried this and while it  *	       didn't slow down the process too much, it could severely  *	       affect the amount of parallelism available as each directory  *	       open would take another file descriptor out of play for  *	       handling I/O for another job. Given that it is only recently  *	       that UNIX OS's have taken to allowing more than 20 or 32  *	       file descriptors for a process, this doesn't seem acceptable  *	       to me.  *	    3) record the mtime of the directory in the Path structure and  *	       verify the directory hasn't changed since the contents were  *	       hashed. This will catch the creation or deletion of files,  *	       but not the updating of files. However, since it is the  *	       creation and deletion that is the problem, this could be  *	       a good thing to do. Unfortunately, if the directory (say ".")  *	       were fairly large and changed fairly frequently, the constant  *	       rehashing could seriously degrade performance. It might be  *	       good in such cases to keep track of the number of rehashes  *	       and if the number goes over a (small) limit, resort to using  *	       stat in its place.  *  *	An additional thing to consider is that pmake is used primarily  *	to create C programs and until recently pcc-based compilers refused  *	to allow you to specify where the resulting object file should be  *	placed. This forced all objects to be created in the current  *	directory. This isn't meant as a full excuse, just an explanation of  *	some of the reasons for the caching used here.  *  *	One more note: the location of a target's file is only performed  *	on the downward traversal of the graph and then only for terminal  *	nodes in the graph. This could be construed as wrong in some cases,  *	but prevents inadvertent modification of files when the "installed"  *	directory for a file is provided in the search path.  *  *	Another data structure maintained by this module is an mtime  *	cache used when the searching of cached directories fails to find  *	a file. In the past, Dir_FindFile would simply perform an access()  *	call in such a case to determine if the file could be found using  *	just the name given. When this hit, however, all that was gained  *	was the knowledge that the file existed. Given that an access() is  *	essentially a stat() without the copyout() call, and that the same  *	filesystem overhead would have to be incurred in Dir_MTime, it made  *	sense to replace the access() with a stat() and record the mtime  *	in a cache for when Dir_MTime was actually called.  */
