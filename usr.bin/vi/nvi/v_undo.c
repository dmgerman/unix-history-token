comment|/* 	 * !!! 	 * In historic vi, 'u' toggled between "undo" and "redo", i.e. 'u' 	 * undid the last undo.  However, if there has been a change since 	 * the last undo/redo, we always do an undo.  To make this work when 	 * the user can undo multiple operations, we leave the old semantic 	 * unchanged, but make '.' after a 'u' do another undo/redo operation. 	 * This has two problems. 	 * 	 * The first is that 'u' didn't set '.' in historic vi.  So, if a 	 * user made a change, realized it was in the wrong place, does a 	 * 'u' to undo it, moves to the right place and then does '.', the 	 * change was reapplied.  To make this work, we only apply the '.' 	 * to the undo command if it's the command immediately following an 	 * undo command.  See vi/vi.c:getcmd() for the details. 	 * 	 * The second is that the traditional way to view the numbered cut 	 * buffers in vi was to enter the commands "1pu.u.u.u. which will 	 * no longer work because the '.' immediately follows the 'u' command. 	 * Since we provide a much better method of viewing buffers, and 	 * nobody can think of a better way of adding in multiple undo, this 	 * remains broken. 	 */
