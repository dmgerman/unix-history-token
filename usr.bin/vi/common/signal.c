comment|/*  * There are seven normally asynchronous actions about which vi cares:  * SIGALRM, SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM, SIGTSTP and SIGWINCH.  *  * The assumptions:  *	1: The DB routines are not reentrant.  *	2: The curses routines may not be reentrant.  *	  * SIGALRM, SIGHUP, SIGTERM  *	Used for file recovery.  The DB routines can't be reentered, so  *	the vi routines that call DB block all three signals (see line.c).  *	This means that DB routines can be called at interrupt time.  *  * SIGALRM  *	Used to paint busy messages on the screen.  The curses routines  *	can't be reentered, so this function of SIGALRM can only be used  *	in sections of code that do not use any curses functions (see  *	busy_on, busy_off in signal.c).  This means that curses can be  *	called at interrupt time.  *  * SIGQUIT  *	Disabled by the signal initialization routines.  Historically,  *	^\ switched vi into ex mode, and we continue that practice.  *  * SIGWINCH:  *	The interrupt routine sets a global bit which is checked by the  *  	key-read routine, so there are no reentrancy issues.  This means  *	that the screen will not resize until vi runs out of keys, but  *	that doesn't seem like a problem.  *  * SIGINT and SIGTSTP are a much more difficult issue to resolve.  Vi has  * to permit the user to interrupt long-running operations.  Generally, a  * search, substitution or read/write is done on a large file, or, the user  * creates a key mapping with an infinite loop.  This problem will become  * worse as more complex semantics are added to vi.  There are four major  * solutions on the table, each of which have minor permutations.  *  * 1:	Run in raw mode.  *  *	The up side is that there's no asynchronous behavior to worry about,  *	and obviously no reentrancy problems.  The down side is that it's easy  *	to misinterpret characters (e.g. :w big_file^Mi^V^C is going to look  *	like an interrupt) and it's easy to get into places where we won't see  *	interrupt characters (e.g. ":map a ixx^[hxxaXXX" infinitely loops in  *	historic implementations of vi).  Periodically reading the terminal  *	input buffer might solve the latter problem, but it's not going to be  *	pretty.  *  *	Also, we're going to be checking for ^C's and ^Z's both, all over  *	the place -- I hate to litter the source code with that.  For example,  *	the historic version of vi didn't permit you to suspend the screen if  *	you were on the colon command line.  This isn't right.  ^Z isn't a vi  *	command, it's a terminal event.  (Dammit.)  *  * 2:	Run in cbreak mode.  There are two problems in this area.  First, the  *	current curses implementations (both System V and Berkeley) don't give  *	you clean cbreak modes. For example, the IEXTEN bit is left on, turning  *	on DISCARD and LNEXT.  To clarify, what vi WANTS is 8-bit clean, with  *	the exception that flow control and signals are turned on, and curses  *	cbreak mode doesn't give you this.  *  *	We can either set raw mode and twiddle the tty, or cbreak mode and  *	twiddle the tty.  I chose to use raw mode, on the grounds that raw  *	mode is better defined and I'm less likely to be surprised by a curses  *	implementation down the road.  The twiddling consists of setting ISIG,  *	IXON/IXOFF, and disabling some of the interrupt characters (see the  *	comments in svi/svi_screen.c).  This is all found in historic System  *	V (SVID 3) and POSIX 1003.1-1992, so it should be fairly portable.  *  *	The second problem is that vi permits you to enter literal signal  *	characters, e.g. ^V^C.  There are two possible solutions.  First, you  *	can turn off signals when you get a ^V, but that means that a network  *	packet containing ^V and ^C will lose, since the ^C may take effect  *	before vi reads the ^V.  (This is particularly problematic if you're  *	talking over a protocol that recognizes signals locally and sends OOB  *	packets when it sees them.)  Second, you can turn the ^C into a literal  *	character in vi, but that means that there's a race between entering  *	^V<character>^C, i.e. the sequence may end up being ^V^C<character>.  *	Also, the second solution doesn't work for flow control characters, as  *	they aren't delivered to the program as signals.  *  *	Generally, this is what historic vi did.  (It didn't have the curses  *	problems because it didn't use curses.)  It entered signals following  *	^V characters into the input stream, (which is why there's no way to  *	enter a literal flow control character).  *  * 3:	Run in mostly raw mode; turn signals on when doing an operation the  *	user might want to interrupt, but leave them off most of the time.  *  *	This works well for things like file reads and writes.  This doesn't  *	work well for trying to detect infinite maps.  The problem is that  *	you can write the code so that you don't have to turn on interrupts  *	per keystroke, but the code isn't pretty and it's hard to make sure  *	that an optimization doesn't cover up an infinite loop.  This also  *	requires interaction or state between the vi parser and the key  *	reading routines, as an infinite loop may still be returning keys  *	to the parser.  *  *	Also, if the user inserts an interrupt into the tty queue while the  *	interrupts are turned off, the key won't be treated as an interrupt,  *	and requiring the user to pound the keyboard to catch an interrupt  *	window is nasty.  *  * 4:	Run in mostly raw mode, leaving signals on all of the time.  Done  *	by setting raw mode, and twiddling the tty's termios ISIG bit.  *  *	This works well for the interrupt cases, because the code only has  *	to check to see if the interrupt flag has been set, and can otherwise  *	ignore signals.  It's also less likely that we'll miss a case, and we  *	don't have to worry about synchronizing between the vi parser and the  *	key read routines.  *  *	The down side is that we have to turn signals off if the user wants  *	to enter a literal character (e.g. ^V^C).  If the user enters the  *	combination fast enough, or as part of a single network packet,  *	the text input routines will treat it as a signal instead of as a  *	literal character.  To some extent, we have this problem already,  *	since we turn off flow control so that the user can enter literal  *	XON/XOFF characters.  *  *	This is probably the easiest to code, and provides the smoothest  *	programming interface.  *  * There are a couple of other problems to consider.  *  * First, System V's curses doesn't handle SIGTSTP correctly.  If you use the  * newterm() interface, the TSTP signal will leave you in raw mode, and the  * final endwin() will leave you in the correct shell mode.  If you use the  * initscr() interface, the TSTP signal will return you to the correct shell  * mode, but the final endwin() will leave you in raw mode.  There you have  * it: proof that drug testing is not making any significant headway in the  * computer industry.  The 4BSD curses is deficient in that it does not have  * an interface to the terminal keypad.  So, regardless, we have to do our  * own SIGTSTP handling.  *  * The problem with this is that if we do our own SIGTSTP handling, in either  * models #3 or #4, we're going to have to call curses routines at interrupt  * time, which means that we might be reentering curses, which is something we  * don't want to do.  *  * Second, SIGTSTP has its own little problems.  It's broadcast to the entire  * process group, not sent to a single process.  The scenario goes something  * like this: the shell execs the mail program, which execs vi.  The user hits  * ^Z, and all three programs get the signal, in some random order.  The mail  * program goes to sleep immediately (since it probably didn't have a SIGTSTP  * handler in place).  The shell gets a SIGCHLD, does a wait, and finds out  * that the only child in its foreground process group (of which it's aware)  * is asleep.  It then optionally resets the terminal (because the modes aren't  * how it left them), and starts prompting the user for input.  The problem is  * that somewhere in the middle of all of this, vi is resetting the terminal,  * and getting ready to send a SIGTSTP to the process group in order to put  * itself to sleep.  There's a solution to all of this: when vi starts, it puts  * itself into its own process group, and then only it (and possible child  * processes) receive the SIGTSTP.  This permits it to clean up the terminal  * and switch back to the original process group, where it sends that process  * group a SIGTSTP, putting everyone to sleep and waking the shell.  *  * Third, handing SIGTSTP asynchronously is further complicated by the child  * processes vi may fork off.  If vi calls ex, ex resets the terminal and  * starts running some filter, and SIGTSTP stops them both, vi has to know  * when it restarts that it can't repaint the screen until ex's child has  * finished running.  This is solveable, but it's annoying.  *  * Well, somebody had to make a decision, and this is the way it's going to be  * (unless I get talked out of it).  SIGINT is handled asynchronously, so  * that we can pretty much guarantee that the user can interrupt any operation  * at any time.  SIGTSTP is handled synchronously, so that we don't have to  * reenter curses and so that we don't have to play the process group games.  * ^Z is recognized in the standard text input and command modes.  (^Z should  * also be recognized during operations that may potentially take a long time.  * The simplest solution is probably to twiddle the tty, install a handler for  * SIGTSTP, and then restore normal tty modes when the operation is complete.)  */
