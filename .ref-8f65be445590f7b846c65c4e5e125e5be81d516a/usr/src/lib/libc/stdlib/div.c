comment|/* 	 * The ANSI standard says that |r.quot|<= |n/d|, where 	 * n/d is to be computed in infinite precision.  In other 	 * words, we should always truncate the quotient towards 	 * 0, never -infinity. 	 * 	 * Machine division and remainer may work either way when 	 * one or both of n or d is negative.  If only one is 	 * negative and r.quot has been truncated towards -inf, 	 * r.rem will have the same sign as denom and the opposite 	 * sign of num; if both are negative and r.quot has been 	 * truncated towards -inf, r.rem will be positive (will 	 * have the opposite sign of num).  These are considered 	 * `wrong'. 	 * 	 * If both are num and denom are positive, r will always 	 * be positive. 	 * 	 * This all boils down to: 	 *	if num>= 0, but r.rem< 0, we got the wrong answer. 	 * In that case, to get the right answer, add 1 to r.quot and 	 * subtract denom from r.rem. 	 */
