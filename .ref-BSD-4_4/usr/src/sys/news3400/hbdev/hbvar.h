comment|/*  * Per-HYPER-BUS structure.  *  * This structure holds the interrupt vector for the HYPER-BUS,  * and its address in physical and virtual space.  At boot time  * we determine the devices attached to the HYPER-BUS and their  * interrupt vectors, filling in vh_vec.  We free the map  * register resources of the HYPER-BUS into the structures  * defined here.  *  * During normal operation, resources are allocated and returned  * to the structures here.  We watch the number of passive releases  * on each HYPER-BUS, and if the number is excessive may reset the HYPER-BUS.  *   * When HYPER-BUS resources are needed and not available,  * then device drivers may have to wait to get to the bus and are  * queued here.  It is also possible for processes to block in  * the HYPER-BUS driver in resource wait (mrwant); these  * wait states are also recorded here.  */
